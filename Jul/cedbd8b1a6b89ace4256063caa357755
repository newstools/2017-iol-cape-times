SABC board chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama says there will be no settlement discussion with former SABC acting CEO James Aguma following his sudden resignation. Aguma resigned on Wednesday in the middle of his disciplinary hearing and, according to Kweyama, he provided no reasons. His decision follows his threat to challenge the disciplinary hearing procedures at the Labour Court, because he was not happy about how it was being conducted. He was being disciplined for a string of charges including that he frustrating his employer during former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng's disciplinary hearing. Kweyama said there is a an acting SABC CEO, who took over when Aguma was suspended, as well as an acting CFO. Meanwhile, Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts said it was shocked by Aguma's decision to step down and said it will view this as admission of guilt following the financial crisis that the public broadcaster was plunged into. "Scopa takes this as admission of guilt for the financial mess the SABC finds itself in. Aguma might have escaped scrutiny on a litany of charges that he was facing. But as Scopa we call upon SABC interim board to pursue its investigations to ascertain the criminal liability on the part of officials and managers at the SABC including Aguma," said Scopa in a statement on Wednesday. Scopa has called on the SABC and the Special Investigating Unit to expedite their investigations so that those found guilty can be charged. Kweyama also hinted at the possibility of recouping the monies that were illegally paid, saying following the necessary investigations processes will be followed to recoup the money. Politics Hub
