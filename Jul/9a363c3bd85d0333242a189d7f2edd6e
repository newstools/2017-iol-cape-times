The South African women's cricket team are moving full steam ahead towards the semi-finals of the Women's World Cup in England. The Proteas started their campaign with a victory over Pakistan, before their second game against New Zealand was washed out. Yesterday, though, Dane van Niekerk and her team trashed the current World T20 champions, the West Indies, by 10 wickets. Among those who congratulated them on Twitter was SA men's captain AB de Villiers, who said: “What a fantastic performance from the @ProteasWomen!!! "Congrats @danevn81 and the girls! Looking good. It was quite surreal. If I could script it I would not have written it like that. "It was very close to perfect. We knew how destructive the West Indies can be, so we just told the bowlers to stick to their line and lengths,” Van Niekerk said afterwards. “I'm really proud of the bowlers, especially my two opening bowlers, they were world class.”
