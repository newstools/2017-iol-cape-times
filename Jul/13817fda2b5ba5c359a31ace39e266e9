The judgment comes after the asylum seeker lodged a complaint that the Department of Labour had refused to pay him his UIF benefits because its computer system did not allow it to process payment to asylum seekers. The department claimed that its computer system did not allow it to process payment to asylum seekers as it accepts only the 13 digit identity number of South 
African citizens. The court awarded damages to the complainant, ordered the department to pay all UIF money to the complainant and correct its computer systems to allow the payment of UIF contributions to asylum seekers, who are lawfully entitled to such. In a statement the SAHRC said: â€œThe commission welcomes the ruling as an important development for the rights of asylum seekers and other non-nationals, who despite their lawful status in South Africa, are being denied their UIF benefits. "The matter raises the prospect that many other non-nationals, who may have faced this problem, have not sought relief as they are not aware of their labour rights," it said.
