The NCR yesterday referred the group, which has 27 retail brands that trade in 3 700 stores in 35 countries, to the National Consumer Tribunal after an investigation revealed Foschini had charged consumers a club fee on credit agreements. The charging of a club fee on credit agreements is not permitted by the National Credit Act, and the NCR has requested the tribunal to: Order Foschini to refund the affected consumers the club fees charged. Order Foschini to conduct an independent audit into its loan book to determine the number of consumers to be refunded. Interdict Foschini from charging consumers a club fee on credit agreements. Impose an appropriate administrative fine on Foschini. In a statement the company said it would oppose the referral to the tribunal.
