The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has launched an investigation into the death of an Imizamo Yethu resident who had sustained head injuries during clashes between police and residents. Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini confirmed yesterday they were conducting a preliminary investigation pending the outcome of a post-mortem.The delay was because of a backlog following the recent strike of the province's mortuary staff. The outcome of the report would decide if an official investigation will be conducted.Songezo Ndude, 26, was among hundreds of residents who took to the streets over the delivery of basic services in Imizamo Yethu this week. Residents demanded re-blocking of the areas affected by the March fire.Residents had gone on the rampage, torching cars and damaging property. Four people, including Ndude s brother Markus, the Imizamo Yethu Movement leader, were arrested.Markus was preparing for his court appearance when he received news of his brother s death. I was in jail when he died and this has deeply wounded our family. The police were shooting and he got a head injury. We are waiting for Ipid to let us know if it was a bullet and what will happen next, said Markus. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said the circumstances of Ndude's death were being investigated by Ipid.
