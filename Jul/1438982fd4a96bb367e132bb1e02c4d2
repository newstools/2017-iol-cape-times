Locally based kung fu champion Muhammad MJ Li Chafeker will be hosting The Western Cape Schools Kung Fu Tournament at Rocklands High School on August 5. Chafeker has brought home the gold three times, representing South Africa in the annual international Legends of Kung Fu Championships in Dallas, Texas. Chafeker said: “I want to bring kung fu into the mainstream for kids as a positive alternative that can keep them busy. “Kung fu enhanced my spirit internally and externally. It helped me tap into my master within. “I never thought I would get the opportunity to go to China and experience another culture, but kung fu opened that door for me. “It is my goal to share this with young people, and to show them that despite where I came from, look where it has taken me.” In February this year he hosted a regional schools tour, where he visited 26 schools, doing demonstrations and motivational talks. Out of the 26 schools, seven expressed interest to continue learning the sport and Chafeker offered his services for free, for one hour a week. He said: “At each school I selected 15 to 25 boys and girls, who showed the most commitment to develop, through a continued after-school programme. “Now this is a chance for them to showcase their talent and show what they've learnt.” They will be competing on a basic level in categories of hand form, full contact, and form with a bow staff. Each school will have a team led by a captain, in a synchronised form. The seven participating schools are from various areas around the province including the Boland, Mitchells Plain, Bonteheuwel, Athlone and Simon's Town. There will be a primary school division, for under 10s and under 12s, and a high school division, for under 15s and under 17s. Up to six of the pupils stand to be selected for a youth development team that will join Chafeker in Hong Kong in March next year for the Hong Kong International Kung Fu Championships.
