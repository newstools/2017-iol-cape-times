An emotional Abigail Ruiters, mother of the murdered child and charged with neglect and murder, was seated next to her co-accused,  Ameeruddien Peters, the boy’s stepfather, who is charged with rape and murder. Ruiters peeked back at her family  in court before wiping her tears. Ruiters who is  seven months' pregnant, was moved to the medical wing of Pollsmoor Prison - it emerged in court yesterday that it is a high-risk pregnancy. After proceedings, Jeremiah’s grandmother, Gail Ruiters, said: “I feel really bad. (Abigail) really worked hard for her children and I thought she would have come out today. She probably wants to go back to work by now.” She also expressed concern over her daughter’s emotional state and said the family is struggling getting to grips with the murder of their grandson. “Before I went to work in the mornings I'd always go to them and I'd play and kiss him but now it’s empty." The rape charge added to the charge sheet at the last court appearance left them in shock. "He was only 18 months old. He was hurt really bad." Peters had attempted suicide last month while in custody. Jeremiah was allegedly beaten and stabbed to death on June 12 after he was left in the care of Peters. The case is back in court on August 16.
