The NSRI thanked the public for their efforts and support in the ongoing search for the body of a 7-year-old Claremont girl swept off the rocks in Betty s Bay on Friday. Louise Fowler was standing with her mother Kim on the rocks when a wave swept her off and a strong current pulled her into the ocean. Louise was on a weekend getaway with her parents. The support we got from the community joining in the search, drone owners driving through from Cape Town offering their time in searching, petrol stations fuelling our vessel at no charge. What an amazing community we live in, the organisation said on its Facebook page.&nbsp; To every single person who offered their time and assistance in helping us, we salute you. The Greenfield Girls Primary School Grade 1 pupil is presumed to have drowned. Her memorial service will take place on Thursday at 2.30pm at Christ Church, Richmond Rd in Kenilworth. Her parents have requested donations to the NSRI instead of flowers.
