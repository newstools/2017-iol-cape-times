Streetscapes' urban gardens, which hires the homeless to work on the land in an effort to uplift them, is now raising funds to bring a third garden to life. A project by NPO Khulisa Social Solution, Streetscapes has so far helped over 30 homeless people to rebuild their lives. The Streetscapes team had asked a group of homeless people, who were facing criminal charges what could help stop their downward spiral, and so the idea was born. The first garden was created in the Roeland Street parking lot in the city centre in 2015. The next transformation was behind Trafalgar High School on the corner of De Waal and Kuyper streets. The third spot is yet to be selected. The Roeland Street garden supervisor Sakhumzi Duma said: “This project has helped many of the homeless and those who were drug addicts and alcoholics.” Streetscapes also provides counselling to help those who live on the streets and grapple with addiction, to beat their demons. Mother of three, Ronel Maker, said she has been living on the streets for more than 13 years. “I started working for the Streetscapes garden in 2015 and it helped me financially, and helped me to overcome my problems, as I was abused by the father of my children and I ended up in the streets.”  For more information visit: https://thundafund.com/project/streetscapes
