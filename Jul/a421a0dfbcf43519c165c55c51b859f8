Durban - On Friday a passing motorist noticed a woman who appeared to be in trouble at a bus shelter on Kassier Road in Hillcrest. 
After stopping and realising the woman was in labour, the good samaritan rushed to Hillcrest Private Hospital and alerted staff as to the situation at the bus stop.
Nurses from the hospital raced to the bus stop and started emergency procedures. Meditech paramedics were also notified and arrived at the scene.
Soon after, the baby girl made her entry into the world and was named Khadidya by her mother. 
The paramedics confirmed both mother and baby were doing well before they were transported to a nearby medical facility. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
