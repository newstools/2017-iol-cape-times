The former lock starred in non-racial rugby in the 1960s and 1970s, and was regarded as one of the finest rugby players from South Africa. He played for the Green Point-based Western Province, who won the Rhodes Cup from 1971 to 1973 under his leadership. Fredericks - who is believed to have been 74 years old at the time of his death - had been suffering from diabetes. He had both legs amputated, which confined him to a wheelchair. He was visited by members of the Springbok team and then-captain Jean de Villiers at his home in 2014. Fredericks played over 200 games for WP, and nine for the Saru team, between 1963 and 1974, with his last match at Athlone Stadium in September 1974. His funeral is set for today in Panorama, with the burial in
