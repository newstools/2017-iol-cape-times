The production will display, to a potentially wider audience, the principal dance forms taught at Dance for All (DFA), and, while DFA maintains these dance forms ballet, contemporary and African contemporary, they shift slightly in introducing students to as many dance forms as possible in future. In support of each student finding their forte, with the aim to strengthen and prepare them in the particular dance form that they excel in, Music a’ la Carte does exactly that and promises to be a mixture of great music moments, a trip down memory lane and a celebration of the magical moments from the musicals. The production will showcase students ranging from 5 to 19 years, from the Outreach programmes and the academy, at DFA’s home base in Athlone, and will illustrate the ongoing growth and development of the students. The event takes place at Artscape Theatre on August 12 at 2.15pm and 8pm.  Tickets range from R50 to R150 and are available through Computicket outlets and Artscape Dial-a-Seat on 021 421 7695.
