The City plans to build 4 500 houses as part of its “integrated housing project” in the area, which has been described as “in the middle of nowhere,” with no job opportunities or schools close by. Currently the area is used as an Incremental Development Area (IDA) - a settlement where people live while, over time, formal housing opportunities are provided. The area is about 30km from the city, has had the spotlight cast on it over the past year, as 27 Bromwell Street residents in Woodstock face being relocated there. The residents have rejected it, saying it was far from schools, health care facilities and transport. The city is now in the process of procuring services to secure land-use rights of the housing development. Service providers, once appointed, will assist with the town planning, as well as an Environmental Impact Assessment, mayoral committee member for transport and urban development Brett Herron said. Bromwell Street resident and spokesperson Charnell Commando said if the city planned to permanently move them into houses in Wolwerivier, they would reject it. The 27 residents, including children, were evicted from their homes after the Woodstock Hub bought the houses in 2013. “When we visited the area this year an ambulance arrived, an ambulance that had been called a day before, but struggled to find the place. I work in Observatory and finish work at 12 in the morning. How will I get home from there?” Commando said. Herron said public participation would form part of the land use and environmental processes, and an investigation of  services and a needs assessment were needed. “It is our intention to create housing opportunities for a cross-section of income groups – from Breaking New Ground-subsidised housing to GAP housing and social housing for those beneficiaries who 
qualify.”
