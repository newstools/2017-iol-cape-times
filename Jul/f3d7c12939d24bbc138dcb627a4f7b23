Cape Town - Chapman’s Peak Drive has been re-opened to traffic. Provincial Department of Transport and Public Works spokesperson Byron la Hoe said the road had been closed for weeks to allow for essential repairs after approximately 
15 cubic metres of rock came down on the Noordhoek end, causing significant damage to two catch fences and the road surface. “The catch fences have been replaced with fences able to withstand twice as much force, and the road was repaired. We thank motorists for their patience during the closure,” he said. “Motorists can expect intermittent road closures on Chapman’s Peak Drive this winter whenever high-risk weather conditions make the road unsafe. “Chappies is a very narrow, winding road built along the edge of very steep slopes that carry an ever-present and severe risk of rockfalls and mudslides.” Regular updates are available via Twitter @ChapmansPeakSA, Facebook, www.chapmanspeakdrive.co.za or by calling 021 791 8222.
