Swimming legend Ryk Neethling, TV personality Siv Ngesi and singer Karen Zoid joined local philanthropic organisations from the community in handing out blankets, warm socks and other treats. Another surprise for the nearly 100 residents was a visit by Stormers players Siya Kolisi, Scarra Ntubeni, Eben Etzebeth and Frans Malherbe, who showed up after flying home from their match in Pretoria. Zoid performed for the residents, who joined her in song as they interacted with the celebrity guests and posed for pictures. Rusthof manager Alvira Kleinhans said it was a privilege for their residents to meet and interact with the figures they normally only get to see on television. Swimmer Neethling said he had had the honour of meeting Mandela and the moment still remained with him. “I met him at his home and he served me himself his humbleness blew me away. That is why I am here, because if a great man like him can be humble, then we do not have any excuse not to be,” he said. La Grange said that it was within every person's ability to give back and keep Mandela’s legacy alive. “The residents will never forget about today, not just from the small gifts but the chance to meet heroes like Ryk and stars like Karen. "This generation, like Madiba, sacrificed for us to have the freedoms we have today and we have a responsibility to give back,” said La Grange. Residents reminded Kolisi that he and his teammates still had a massive game coming up next weekend and that they were rooting for them.
