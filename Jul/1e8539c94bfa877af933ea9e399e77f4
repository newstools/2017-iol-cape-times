Newcastle - The case against EFF leader Julius Malema was postponed to Thursday July 6 at the Newcastle Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. Malema, sharply dressed and looking calm, made a brief appearance at the court over his land grab calls to supporters.He was charged&nbsp;on common law charges of incitement to commit a crime. The EFF confirmed on Monday that Malema was facing a new charge, which is:&nbsp;&quot;incitement to commit a crime to wit: trespass in contravention of Section 1(1) read with Section 2(1) of the Trespass Act. Act 6 of 1959 as amended by the Criminal Law Amendment Act 59 of 1983&quot;.&nbsp;Malema's lawyer Tumi Mokoena, during the brief appearance, requested a postponement, pending the outcome of a High Court application on the same matter.&nbsp;Another reason cited by Mokoena was that the defence only received the docket for Tuesday's matter in May despite the NPA promising to hand it over in February.&nbsp;With the agreement of both parties, Magistrate Theunis Christiaan Lotter Colditz agreed to postpone the matter to allow Malema to file his application.&quot;The matter has been postponed until July 6, pending the filing of your application, and should the papers be filed and you do not appear; as per the agreement then the matter will be postponed to September 2017,&quot; Colditz ruled.&nbsp;Malema came under fire in November last year when, following an appearance at the same court, he&nbsp;told his supporters to occupy the land because they have failed to give you the land . If it means going to prison for telling you to take the land, so be it. I am not scared of prison because of the land question, but I am scared of prison if I go to prison for corruption. I don t want to go to prison for corruption, but I want to go to prison for the land, he told supporters. IOL
