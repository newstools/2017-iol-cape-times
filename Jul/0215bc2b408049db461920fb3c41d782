UWC spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo said the university had been informed that the arrest of Bleki relates to the alleged assault of security officers in June, a charge that was laid by the security officers concerned. “It is our understanding that SAPS has investigated the matter, which has led to the arrest. “We have also been informed that Asanda Bleki violated his bail conditions on a charge of attempted murder. We are informed that the police arrested him at his court appearance on the attempted murder charges,” he said. His case has been postponed and he remained in custody
following his court appearance last week. “Asanda was arrested at a later stage by the Bellville South Police on his way coming back to campus, indicating that there are new charges against him. “This is a clear indication that leaving home to attend a court case carries with it the possibility that you may not return,” the UWC SRC said in a statement. The SRC said Bleki and four fellow students who were arrested in 2015 during the FeesMustfall protests appeared in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court last week and the state Spposed bail. Bleki’s friend, Sihle Masika, said one of the bail conditions was that he was not to be violent or be part of mass protests. “When he was denied bail he wasn’t in a great state of mind. ‘‘But he is a strong person and will overcome this,” Masika said. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: “A 28-year-old man was arrested and he appeared in Bellville Magistrates’ Court on July 28 for contravening a protection order and public violence and he remains in custody.” His case was postponed to September 7.
