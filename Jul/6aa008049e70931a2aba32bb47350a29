Parliament's standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) said it was shocked by the sudden resignation of James Aguma, chief financial officer of the embattled SABC, before the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings against him.
 
In a statement, Scopa chairperson Themba Godi said it took Aguma's resignation "as admission of guilt for the financial mess that the SABC finds itself in". "Mr Aguma might have avoided scrutiny on a litany of charges that he was facing – but as Scopa we call on the SABC interim board to pursue its investigation to ascertain criminal liability on the part of all officials and managers at the SABC, including Mr Aguma.
 
"From the internal audit report on evergreen contracts, Scopa believes that some officials, including Mr Aguma, may have a further case to answer. Scopa calls on the internal forensic audit unit of the SABC and the Special Investigating Unit to expedite their processes so that those who are liable can be held to account for the irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure."
 
Scopa added that it would like to congratulate the SABC's interim board for its "relentless effort to clean the SABC and to end the impunity that wrongdoers like Mr Aguma have enjoyed for so long". "As Scopa has said before, the tide has turned against corrupt officials at the SABC and as a committee, we will continue to keep a close watch over the SABC until there is strict adherence to the Public Finance Management Act and National Treasury regulations on the management and expenditure of public funds."
