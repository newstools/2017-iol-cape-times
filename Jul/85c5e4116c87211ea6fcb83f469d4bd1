Former Eskom acting CEO Matshela Koko will face a disciplinary hearing following allegations of corrupt activity. The announcement was made by Eskom interim board chairperson Zethembe Khoza at the power utilities' briefing to announce its financial results on Wednesday. "The board has taken a decision to pursue disciplinary action against Mr Koko. The minister of public enterprises (Lynne Brown) has been informed of this decision," said Khoza. Koko has faced public criticism after it emerged that Eskom awarded contracts to a company linked to his step-daughter. He has been on leave since the reports emerged while the allegations were being investigated. The decision to investigate him follows an investigation by a law firm appointed by Eskom to look into the allegations. Koko had taken over from former CEO Brian Molefe who resigned last year following the release of the State of Capture report that linked him to the controversial Gupta family. @ZintleMahlati Politics Hub  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
