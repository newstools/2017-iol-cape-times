Johannesburg - Two Gauteng community safety department officials are to appear in the Johannesburg Commercial Crimes Court on Monday on charges of corruption, the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) said. The female transport compliance officers, aged 41 and 36, were arrested at Langlaagte Vehicle Testing Centre on Friday after allegedly taking a R9 000 bribe from a scholar transport operator who required a roadworthy certificate, RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said. A third suspect was being sought and was expected to be arrested on Monday, he said. The arrests were made jointly by the National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit, the South African Police Service, and the Gauteng inspectorate. The arrested officials faced a possible 15 years imprisonment if found guilty. The Langlaagte testing centre had been prioritised following numerous Â public complaints of corruption and bribery. Investigations were continuing in other provinces as well and more arrests were pending, Zwane said. Members of the public were urged to report corruption and bribery involving testing stations and traffic officials on 0861-400-800. African News Agency
