Ndude, 26, had sustained head injuries when hundreds of residents were embroiled in running battles with the police during protests in Imizamo Yethu in Hout Bay earlier this month. Residents demanded re-blocking of the areas affected by a fire in March. They had gone on the rampage, torching cars and damaging property. Four people, including Ndude’s brother Markus, the Imizamo Yethu Movement leader, were arrested. Following Ndude's death, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) got involved after it was alleged he was shot by police. Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said: “The post-mortem  reveals that the deceased died from blunt force trauma. It is not known whether it was from a gunshot, brick or other object. An inquest docket is being investigated,” he said. He said the docket would be sent to the National Prosecuting Authority once their investigation had been completed, Markus Ndude said the family was distraught after his death. “ We still cannot accept the way he died but unfortunately we cannot bring him back,” he said. He said  they received a call on Monday to inform them of the  post-mortem findings. “We will be burying my brother this weekend in the Eastern Cape,” he added. Meanwhile, mayor Patricia de Lille along with the city's new project portfolio management team and various senior city management officials met the Imizamo Yethu community leadership. De Lille said the meeting served to update the community leadership on the consolidated super-blocking plan. “The majority of the people in Imizamo Yethu are working with us and want to see the project being completed. "However, there is a minority of people who need to be moved so that the project can progress. We need to keep spaces open so that we can build roads and install  water, stormwater, electricity, and sanitation infrastructure,”
