A man had entered the police station under the pretext of reporting a robbery about 3am. Two more men  stormed into the station and opened fire on the officers. Police fired back as one man jumped over the counter at reception. It’s unclear whether any of the suspects were injured in the shoot-out. Yesterday Police Deputy Minister Bongani Mkongi visited the area and lauded the officers for their efforts. The criminals  were after police firearms, he said. During the visit, Khayelitsha cluster commander General Johan Brand said they had upgraded security at the police station to mitigate the risk of such incidents happening again. It was the second time there had been a shooting at the police station since it opened 15 years ago. “The sad part is that this specific person came to report a complaint. We open doors for the community in order to serve them and that is our motto. But once we start being attacked in the police station, we have no choice but to upgrade security in such a way that access to it can only be via an intercom system,” he said. Brand said he had consulted community leaders about the move. “Please do not get offended if you must press the button to enter the police station. "Please understand the reasoning behind this,” he told the gathering. Mkhongi said he was appalled by the persistent attacks on police officers. “I came here to support the police at Lingelethu West Police station shot by thugs and criminals who wanted to rob the firearms to terrorise the community and kill the police. "I am talking with a broken heart because we lost an officer this morning in Vosloorus who was searching a suspicious car. The criminals did not negotiate with the police. They shot and killed one of us,” he said.
