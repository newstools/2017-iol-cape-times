This is according to Mr South Africa Habib Noorbhai, 28, who graduates with a PhD in exercise science from the University of Cape Town today. Noorbhai is a lecturer and researcher in sports science at the Cape Peninsula University of 
Technology. He is set to graduate from UCT with a PhD that focused on batting back-lift technique in cricket. Noorbhai said working smarter, not harder, has been key to his success and he has always managed his time effectively. He played cricket from the age of five, until a back injury in 2007. Noorbhai graduated from the University of Johannesburg with a BA in sport psychology, has honours in biokinetics from the University of KwaZulu-Natal, and has a MPhil in biokinetics from UCT. He aims to further his academic career in the health and sports sciences, as well as supervise postgraduate students. Despite his studies, Noorbhai has continued the humanitarian work required of Mr SA. “We are on this world for a short time. We need to spend most of our time out of our comfort zone evoking sustainable change in the lives of others,” he said. “There is no better feeling changing someone’s life even if it’s only one day or one random act of kindness. “The ink of a scholar and heart of a humanitarian is holier than the blood of a martyr,” Noorbhai added.
