The boy’s traumatised father, Thamsanqa, told the Cape Times that he and his son had spent time watching TV the night before the incident. “He really enjoyed playing soccer and was enjoying the last week of school holidays.” Ayabonga’s uncle, Thabang Malgas, said the boy’s mother, who is currently in the Eastern Cape with their three-year-old daughter, was devastated by the news. “When Thamsanqa left for work, he woke Ayabonga to lock the door behind him. Ayabonga locked the door and that was the last he saw his son.” Ayabonga was a pupil at Kairos Primary School in Leiden. He will be buried in the Eastern Cape.
