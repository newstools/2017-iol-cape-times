Police condoned off the intersection for two-and-a-half-hours to search for suspects before the technical response team (TRT) arrived to assist. The TRT searched inside the Cash Crusaders store, but the robbers had escaped with a cellphone long before the police arrived. Traffic was halted at St George's Mall and Long and Loop streets as police kept people from the scene. Twenty minutes after the robbery had taken place, police dragged two men, one an employee and another a customer, out of the store, thinking they were the robbers. The storeâ€™s employees were taken out of the store safely. A parking marshal close to the crime scene described it as chaotic and like a scene from a movie, as hundreds of people came to see what was happening. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said police were investigating a case of business robbery, not a hostage situation as some thought, and no one had been arrested. sandiso.phaliso@inl.co.a
