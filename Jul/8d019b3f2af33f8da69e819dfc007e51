The Steenberg Community Police Forum (CPF), which is also responsible for Lavender Hill, said residents in Lavender Hill were living in fear of gangsters, which has tormented them for the last week. Three people, aged 19, 29, and 38 were killed in shootings this week. The 38-year-old was hit in the neck by a stray bullet as he stood at a shop, said CPF chairperson Gavin Walbrugh. Another five people, including a 12-year-old boy, have received medical attention after they were wounded. The boy was hit by a stray bullet in his hand on Wednesday, Walbrugh said. “I am getting calls late at night, especially from older people, who are fearing for their children’s lives. Children can’t play outside. It’s happening all over,” Walbrugh said. Extra policing resources are in the area. These include the public order police, and metro police. Walbrugh would not get into details about the alleged gang shootings, but said there are four main gangs which have been distracting police by “random shootings” in areas. “They shoot in one area to distract police from what they are doing in another area,” Walbrugh said.
