The driver and passenger were not injured.” Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said: “The incident will be investigated internally by Metrorail in conjunction with the police report At this stage it is premature to speculate on the outcome. "We appeal to motorists, pedestrians and cyclists to approach level crossings with caution.” In another incident at the weekend, one person was killed and at least 15 others injured after a taxi and a bakkie collided at a set of robots next to Welgevonden estate in Stellenbosch on Saturday morning.
