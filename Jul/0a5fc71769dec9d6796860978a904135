This is as the aquarium has declared a Plastic Free July by highlighting International Plastic Bag Free Day today. The Rethink the Bag campaign was launched by Hayley McLellan, the aquarium’s environmental campaigner, who has worked since 2010 to educate the public and retailers, establish partnerships and promote the campaign. The aquarium says a single-use plastic shopping bag has a “tremendous impact” on the environment. South African consumers use about 8 billion shopping bags each year. Of these, 96% end up in landfills and threaten the lives of marine and terrestrial animals, according to the aquarium. It says research has shown the average functioning lifespan of a plastic shopping bag is a mere 20 minutes, after which it is discarded. The aquarium has urged the public to refuse single-use plastic shopping bags today and accept the Plastic Free July challenge. “All role-players, especially consumers, remain responsible for the approximately 8 billion plastic shopping bags we use every year in South Africa. Remember that demand drives supply, so let’s simply stop demanding and choosing them. Celebrate International Plastic Bag Free Day on July 3, and every day thereafter, by always choosing re-usable bags instead,” said McLellan. Plastic Free July is a worldwide campaign which aims to raise awareness and asks people to pledge to forgo plastic shopping bags, takeaway containers and cutlery, coffee cups and lids, and straws for the month of July.
