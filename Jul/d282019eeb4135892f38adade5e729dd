The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Daff) says the court's order, to dismiss Viking Inshore Fishing's interdict against the department, has vindicated its attempts to ensure new entrants in the Hake Inshore Trawl sector are able to utilise their granted fishing rights. This is a victory for both the department and small fishing companies, who were prevented from operating in the sector for the past six months, the department said. The department yesterday said the ongoing challenge to the decision made by its deputy director-general, to include previously disadvantaged new entrants during its 2015/16 Fishing Rights Allocation Process (FRAP), was brought to an end as the application to interdict the decision was dismissed with costs.Viking Inshore Fishing won the first round of a battle after the court ruled in favour of its interdict against new fishing rights in January - a decision that puts on ice the department's latest allocation of fishing rights and quantum in the hake inshore trawl and sole fishery sector, as it had sought to implement its affirmative action transformation criteria. Viking Inshore Fishing interdicted the Daff from issuing permits that would have allowed it to implement its 2016 rights allocation decisions in the inshore trawl fishery. Viking Fishing believed that by granting the rights to new entrants, it would lead to job losses in its operations as the company's quota would be cut by 60%.The court heard that Daff explained the entire allocation process and gave reasonable explanations of its attempt to give effect to section 2(j) of the Marine Living Resources Act (MLRA) and the constitution. The order made by the court has vindicated the department's attempts to ensure that new entrants in the Hake Inshore Trawl sector are able to utilise the fishing rights granted to them in terms of section 18 of the MLRA, the department said. Viking operations director Tim Reddell said the court's ruling was not unanimous and that one of the three presiding judges handed down a dissenting judgment, finding that Viking did demonstrate a clear right to the interdict originally granted in January.
