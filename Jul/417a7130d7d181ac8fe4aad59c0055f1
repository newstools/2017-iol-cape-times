I must say I find the whole concept of voting along party lines flawed. Why even bother to vote then as the majority party has to win! Surely the whole point of voting is either one agrees or disagrees with what is on the agenda, and therefore one should be able to either vote for or against the motion, or at least abstain? We are not all sheep that we blindly have to follow something with which we totally disagree. ANC MP Makhozi Khoza is a case in point. Here is a fine MP who stands up for her rights and, I may add, the rights of the citizens she is representing. Whether she will be there for much longer in Parliament is debatable as the party is gunning for her. This cannot be right, surely? Mindsets need to change, and this applies to all parties otherwise the whole process of voting is flawed. But I don't hold my breath. â€‹Barbie Sandler Claremont
