Douman went hiking alone on the Witriver trail on Saturday morning. On Sunday he had called his family by cellphone to inform them he had injured his ankle but was able to walk to the road where he could be collected. But he didn't arrive and nobody has heard from him since. The Wilderness Search and Rescue, assisted by rangers from the CapeNature and Wellington visible policing, launched a search for him. Yesterday, Wilderness Search and Rescue spokesperson Johann Marais said: “We are having difficulties finding him because of the rain and fog.” Anyone who may have information is asked to call Constable Bianca Joseph at Wellington SAPS on 021864 8480 or Crime Stop on 0860010111.
