Despite huge commercial losses, Knysna remains hopeful and open for business. Through a concerted community effort, residents, businesses and local government are working hard to get things back on track. With nearly 10 000 residents evacuated and homes, schools, structures, power and communication lines destroyed, damage has been estimated at more than R4 billion. Knysna Tourism Board chairperson Elmay Bouwer said there were a number of challenges to deal with. Bouwer said 33 tourism establishments and activities had been affected, 25 of which offered accommodation. “Even though 254 rooms were affected, we still have 4 000 beds available,” she said. She added that Knysna remained a golfing destination and that all golf courses remained open, as well as restaurants at prime tourist destinations. She also noted that only part of the forest had been burnt and that walkways and the waterfall were still unaffected. “Tourism is our main economic driver, and we need the support of the international and local communities to help keep this economy going and protect the jobs of thousands,” she said. With the Oyster Festival starting this weekend, they had managed to fill all remaining accommodation. Retail Capital chief executive Karl Westvig and his company have come on board to provide financial support to small businesses, by providing micro loans as 38% of the affected businesses were not covered by any insurance. “Small businesses are in desperate need of funding,” he said. Knysna Hollow Country Estate hotel manager Liesel Barttell said: "The hotel is not operating any more. The fire damaged most of it and the main building was destroyed. We lost 61 rooms from the 87 that we had. “However, we are trying to get back on our feet. Hopefully, we will open again in about a year.’’
