Miss South Africa, via its Twitter account, shared the pictures of Nel-Peters during the distribution, and mingling with the community, which prompted the backlash. In a video, Nel-Peters went on to clarify her reason for wearing gloves, stating that as they were preparing food they had to wear gloves for hygienic purposes. However, Twitter was not buying. Twitter users found photos of her posing with white children without gloves and also found pictures of her preparing food for the Knysna firefighters without gloves. @gopzeee tweeted: WHY is #MissSA wearing gloves when doing charity work in Soweto? @manqoba_ngubo said: Please may you delete this post. There is no greater disrespect for the BLACK children that are on these pictures than those GLOVES! @Isaac_Moselane tweeted: #MissSA wears gloves to touch black kids. To pretend she’s eating with them for pictures. To her, black kids are only good enough for pics. Miss South Africa then released a statement, which read: “The purpose was to help prepare and serve a hot meal to 300 people, as part of an ongoing campaign, in which The Maslow has committed to feed thousands of people this month at various locations across Johannesburg and Pretoria. “All volunteers, including Demi-Leigh, wore disposable sanitary gloves while working with the food and handing it out. It is standard hygiene practice that ready-to-eat food be prepared and served without bare hand contact,” the statement read. “While Demi was handing out food she was asked to pose for photos so she still had the gloves on. “She did not wear disposable gloves throughout the entire visit. “She was also involved in handing out blankets to those who attended.”
