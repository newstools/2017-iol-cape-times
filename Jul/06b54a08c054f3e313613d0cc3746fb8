This is going to be a bit controversial. I love Islam but there are certain things that make me wonder. That brah that wrote 40 000 hadiths in two years. there are 365 days in a year which makes it 740 days in two years," he said at the festival. The 'brah' that he referred to was one of the companions to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). “There’s 365 days in a year which makes it 740 days in two years which gives you 1440 minutes per day, plus you must sleep. How can you write forty thousand hadiths in two years?”  Shortly after that, he made remarks about women who were clearly offended by his comments. He was then told to get off the stage by one of the audience.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
