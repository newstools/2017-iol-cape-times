Emma and her grandfather Aubrey Murphy were attacked last month after they heard a noise in their backyard. Aubrey opened the door to investigate and Emma ran outside. It seems this startled the two dogs, who were rummaging near the bins, and they attacked Emma. Aubrey and other neighbours tried distracting the dogs by banging spades on the walls and throwing objects at them, to no avail. Aubrey then lay on top of Emma to protect her. He was then attacked by the dogs until neighbours could free him. Emma’s twin sister Kate witnessed the dog attack. Emma and her grandfather were left with extensive injuries, with the little girl having undergone about 10 operations since the attack. She is still to undergo more surgery and is being treated at the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital. Aubrey was discharged from Vincent Pallotti Hospital earlier this month. Tracy, the twins' mother, has had to close her salon, while she makes sure her daughter makes a full recovery. Kate has returned to school and the girls have started  play therapy to get through the trauma they experienced. So far, Emma’s campaign has raised R158472 towards their target of R250000. The girl’s’ father, Carl Murphy, says the family was pleased that the funding they have so far received will help them with expenses their medical aid does not cover. “We are very thankful and grateful to everyone who has funded us and kept us in their prayers. "It means everything to us a family, ” Carl said. The crowdfunding campaign is run through Backabuddy. It was started by Paula Pinkham, a close friend of the girls’ mother, who co-incidentally also has twins.
