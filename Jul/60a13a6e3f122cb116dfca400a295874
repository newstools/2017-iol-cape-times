Caledon magistrate Juanita Lamberts earlier this week ruled that no proof was brought before court that the municipality had made an effort to reach Sampson nor could it prove he was not present in April 2015 when they impounded his animals on Drievlei farm. The magistrate dismissed with costs the application by the TWK to sell six horses, which belonged to pensioner Sampson. The magistrate found that the TWK did not follow correct procedures in terms of the by-laws on impounding and hence had no right to confiscate the animals and sell them off to recoup costs. Sampson said hearing the outcome of his case was like a lost arm miraculously growing back, but he feared impounding would occur again as he had no land available to house his horses. Riviersonderend pensioner Nosinothi Ntsombo, 80, made the trek to get answers yesterday regarding her 16 goats impounded by the municipality for wandering on to a golf course. “Ever since they took my goats it’s been very hard because I only have my pension and I have to feed my children and grandchildren. They said the municipality must pay me for the goats so I can buy more, but where will I put them as we still have problems about land?” said Ntsombo. Trust Community Outreach regional researcher Boyce Tom said the meeting was to plot the way forward for the entire small-scale farming  community.
