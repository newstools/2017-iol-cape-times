Plato, who was a guest at Bush Radio near the scene of the incident on Tuesday afternoon, told the Cape Times that the matter had been reported to the police and a search for the suspects and Ahmed was under way. Ahmed was packing items in his white BMW when four men wearing masks pulled up in a bakkie. One of his employees, who was with him at the time, tried to wrestle with the men but was overpowered. It is alleged that the suspects used a Taser to subdue Ahmed and left the staff member unharmed. Ahmed’s son, Ashraf Ahmed, could not comment when approached yesterday. A witness told Bush Radio’s Tammy Koeberg: “The four suspects jumped from a white bakkie, wrestled with the man who is allegedly a business owner. One of his staff tried to pull him out of the grip of the suspects. "One of the four suspects pulled out a Taser and tasered the man, leaving the staff member there. "Apparently the man was putting things into the boot of his white BMW. "The four suspects then forced the man into the bakkie and fled the scene." The getaway vehicle was later discovered abandoned in Victoria Road, Woodstock. Police have appealed to the public to assist in any information about the incident. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said: “The circumstances about the disappearance of Mr Zhaun are still unknown at this stage as the investigation continues.” Anyone with information is requested to contact the investigation officer David Miles at 021 486 2840 or crime stop on 086 0010 111.
