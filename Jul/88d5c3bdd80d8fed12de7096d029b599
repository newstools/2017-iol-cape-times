The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco)&nbsp;on Tuesday&nbsp;called for the Western Cape provincial government and City of Cape Town to speed up housing delivery and the provision of basic services in Imizamo Yethu informal settlement. In a statement, Sanco spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said: The historic poor housing delivery track record and failure to keep communities&nbsp;informed&nbsp;of progress does not inspire confidence that the informal settlement eradication programme is a priority .&nbsp;The City and Imizamo Yethu residents have had their differences. Some residents were allegedly refusing to vacate a piece of land, where the City was due to start building homes for the now-displaced residents.Mahlangu said that pressure had to be&nbsp;exerted on the DA administration to end the apartheid legacy of deprivation and homelessness .&nbsp; The&nbsp;non-delivery of housing projects that will create sustainable livelihoods and improve the quality of the lives of our people is an inexcusable violation of human rights . In March, a number of residents were displaced after a fire damaged their homes and they were moved to a&nbsp;vacant piece of land nearby. The residents claimed that mayor, Patricia de Lille promised them that the make-shift structures would be temporary homes for three months.The residents say the promise was made four months ago.
