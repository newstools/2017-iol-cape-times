The man was wounded after he allegedly pointed a toy firearm at the officer. According to Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini, the officer wanted to conduct a search before the suspect fled. “It is alleged that the metro police officer was on duty, he wanted to search the deceased. It is alleged that the deceased took out a gun and pointed it at the police officer. All witness statements were obtained. The investigation continues,” Dlamini said. The city’s mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said: “While on duty at a roadblock, metro police officers observed two males running away from the roadblock last week on Thursday. They gave chase and one of the men then turned around and pointed a firearm at the officers. “The officer fired a shot at the suspect and struck him. He later died as a result of his injuries. It was later found that the firearm belonging to the suspect was a replica,” Smith said. He said the city was co-operating with the police and the Ipid in the investigation.
