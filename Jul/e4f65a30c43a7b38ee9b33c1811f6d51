Cape Town - A woman was gang-raped at the weekend, allegedly by the suspects who hijacked her partner in Avonwood Square in Elsies River. The victims, a 26-year-old man and his girlfriend, were hijacked by four male suspects, who drove off with his vehicle with his girlfriend still inside, who was then raped by two of the suspects, said police spokesperson Andre Traut.He would not say what happened to her partner. The circumstances about a hijacking and rape that occurred on Saturday at around 3.20am at Avonwood Square, Elsies River, are being investigated, he said. There have not yet been any arrests. The incident came a day after the body of a 23-year-old Pakistani business owner was recovered in Delft. He was reported missing on Thursday. Abdul Haseeb s red Audi A3, which he was driving at the time he was last seen, has yet to be found. It is understood that Haseeb was on his way to Rylands and never returned to Elsies River area.
