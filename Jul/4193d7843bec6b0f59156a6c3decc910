The DA on Monday filed its heads of argument to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). It maintains that both President Jacob Zuma and the National Prosecuting Authority s (NPA) requests for leave to appeal are void of any merit and should be dismissed with costs.&quot;We contend that both applications for leave fail to meet the requirements of having a credible chance of success and compelling reasons why they should be heard. It is in the interests of the rule of law, due process and the constitution that the prosecution continue as per the order of the North Gauteng High Court,&quot; it said in a statement.&quot;It is of the utmost public interest that Mr Zuma stand trial for the 783 charges of fraud, corruption, racketeering and money laundering for which he stands accused without delay.&quot;We are encouraged that the SCA has been prepared to hear this case on such an accelerated basis and we look forward to arguing that both appeals should be dismissed with costs on 15 September, 2017.&quot;This battle has been hard-fought by DA for more than eight years and we will continue to fight for Mr Zuma to have his day in court so that justice can finally be served.&quot;
