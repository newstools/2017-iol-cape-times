The City s benefits for lower-income residents have increased from R2.5 billion to R2.7bn for the 2017/18 financial year. As of July 1, the total value of social assistance packages from the City had risen to R2.7bn. This was due to the allocation of an extra R200m for rates relief for the most vulnerable residents, mayoral committee member for finance Johan van der Merwe said yesterday. The latest increase reflects the City s strong commitment to ensuring that the cost of living remains within affordable levels for economically marginalised residents. These packages are essential to ensuring that the most vulnerable among us continue to receive basic services such as water and electricity, he said. We encourage all struggling residents to visit their nearest walk-in centre to explore the options available to them. Financial challenges will not go away if they are ignored. There are options available. We are encouraging a culture of payment with assistance for those who qualify, he said. We have also introduced a new rates rebate of R50 a month for households whose properties are valued between R400 001 and R750 000.&nbsp;&quot;Residents who would like to apply will need proof of identification (such as your ID book), a bank statement for the last three months or a sworn affidavit stating that you do not have a bank account, a bond statement for the last three months or a sworn affidavit stating that you do not have a bond account, and if you have inherited the house a copy of the estate documents, Van der Merwe said.&nbsp; African News Agency
