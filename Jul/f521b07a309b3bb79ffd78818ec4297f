Chad Hodson, 22, and Mogammed Asheeq Saunders, 23, are alleged to have been members of the School Boys, and were shot by members of an alleged rival gang in Weltevreden Road, Rocklands, at 10.50am on Saturday. Both men were last known to have been just outside their homes, when their families suddenly heard gunshots. Hodson’s aunt, Verona Booysen, said: “I thought he was still sitting in front. When I realised he had been shot, I rushed to his side. “I was desperate to save him. He tried to talk to me but it’s like he could not breathe, so the words would not come out. “I tried my best to get Chad to hospital as fast as possible.” She said 20 minutes after arriving at Mitchells Plain Day Hospital, he died. Booysen could not stop crying as she reminisced about her nephew. She said Hodson was like a son to her and the events of Saturday were a case of history repeating itself. “My son was also shot dead at the age of 23 a few years ago. All I wanted was to save Chad because I could not save my son. “I don’t know how I am going to move on, I cannot deal with this. “He was like my own child,” she said. Hodson’s funeral will take place on Saturday at the Baptist church in Rocklands. Saunders was shot 16 times. His mother, Mareldia Hendricks, said his death had not sunk in yet. “I have to make peace with it. “Once your child belongs to a gang, you can expect anything,” she said. Hendricks was buried yesterday. Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said they were investigating. In a separate incident at a petrol station in Lenton Drive, Bishop Lavis, about 1.20am, two petrol attendants were killed and another petrol attendant and a client were injured. Van Wyk said: “Murder and attempted murder cases were registered for investigation.” Anyone with any information about this shooting incident is kindly requested to contact Crime Stop 0860010111.  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
