Pillay’s organisation, which provides day care, educational programmes and skills training for people with disabilities, stopped its programmes after he was evicted from their new help desk office. Parents whose children were members of the group, said they were worried about the impact the disruption had on their children. Group facilitator Adenaan de Bruyn, who is wheelchair-bound, said there were limited accessible facilities for the disabled in poorer communities. “We teach our members how to knit, bead and provide them with daily activities and also meals each day. "Last week, we asked the manager (February) where we were supposed to go and she said she didn't care.” He said the matter had meant their members were left fearing that their daily routine would be taken away from them. However, February said the group had not been evicted, but she had evicted Pillay from an office he had been using because he was unable to afford the monthly instalments. She said she had no problem with the group continuing to use the facility, but Pillay remained banned and it was either her or him. Pillay said that February's “abuse of her authority was due to her personal gripe with him and selfish reasons in wanting him gone”. Ward councillor Angus Mckenzie said he was hesitant to assist the group in moving to another facility, due to the disruption this would cause their members. An investigation into the dispute, as well as the management of the multi-purpose centre was under way in pursuit of a resolution, said Mckenzie.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
