“So much has happened at SAA. So many chief executives have come and gone. So much money has been invested in the airline for guarantees and bail outs. A point must be reached where we no longer invest public resources to fund inefficiencies,” he told journalists as he unpacked the 14-point plan to revitalise the economy. Gigaba said the SAA board had submitted the name of a preferred candidate for chief executive and that he had applied his mind. “We need to appoint a chief executive with experience in managing a company of this size. At the end of the day South Africa believes that we should have an airline that works,” he said. As part of the 14-point action plan Gigaba will lead the finalisation and the implementation of SAA’s five-year turnaround plan by December 2019 and negotiate with lenders to extend debt to longer-term by the end of October.
