Shocked residents woke up to the grim discovery of the two bodies. Community Leader Rooi Nobatana said said he had heard noise about 12.30am on Sunday. “There is information about an argument that broke out in one of the local taverns about a phone. If the police had arrived on time, there is a chance the two people would still be alive. I had a chat with one of the police lieutenants and he said he would address the matter and get back to me,” said Nobatana. Police spokesperson  Andre Traut said a murder case was opened. In another case three people were shot and wounded in separate shootings in Lavender Hill at the weekend. Shaylin Jacobs, 27, was wounded in the chest and hand near her home in Shepherd Way. Natalie Rubain was wounded in the back after Shaylin’s’ shooting. Traut said  a 43-year-old resident was shot and wounded in Drury Court. No one has been arrested.
