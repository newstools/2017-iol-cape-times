The ANC has called for the downgrading of the South African embassy in Israel due to the ongoing conflict with Palestine, saying it was concerned by Israel s lack of commitment on Palestine. Speaking at the 5th national policy conference, the ANC s international relations commission chairperson, Merriam Segabutla, said this was one of the ways the ANC was intensifying its solidarity with the people of Palestine, and also pressurising the Israeli government. The commission reaffirmed the ANC s steadfast commitment to the struggle of the people of Palestine; and its disappointment regarding Israel s lack of commitment towards peace with the Palestine people. The commission debated the continued illegal occupation of Palestine by Israel which is at its 50th year, and Israel s non-compliance with international law. It called for the downgrading of the embassy to send a strong message about Israel s continued illegal occupation and continued human rights abuses against Palestinians. Segabutla said there was another call for a complete and total shut down of the South African Embassy in Israel. However, the dominant view was that of downgrading. There was also a call for the ANC to make a risk analysis on calling for a downgrade of the embassy. The commission recommended that the ANC host a global solidarity conference on Palestine consisting of liberation movements of Palestine and all other international progressive movements supporting their liberation. The commission also recommended ANC support for the Kurdish people s struggle for political rights and called for the release of their leader, Abdullah &Ouml;calan, and all political prisoners.
