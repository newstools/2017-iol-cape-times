Cameron, 14, was raped, murdered and her mutilated body dumped in bushes near the Ocean View police station on July 2. The teenager’s body was found after a frantic search by residents. A suspect in the case, 19-year-old Yagyah Rubain, who is related to Cameron, was arrested after he turned himself in. Rubain appeared in court last week and is currently in police custody. He will appear in court again on August 8. Hundreds of residents formed a human chain alongside Kommetjie Road on Saturday. The day before, a memorial service was held in Cameron’s honour. About 33 children have been found murdered since the beginning of 2017, said Lorraine Botha, chairperson of the Standing Committee on Community Development in the provincial legislature. Councillor Patricia Francke, who was part of the human chain, said that the aim was to “peacefully show unity to the families of those killed in violence. Even though there is pain and sorrow, we cannot be divided and must stand united as a community. "I understand the fears but we need to work closer to the community in order to get results and to make the area safer,” she said. Ocean View resident Rowina Solomons said the human chain was “a harmonious movement of solidarity to show support to the individuals who were directly affected by the violence".  It was a symbolic event calling for a reaction, she said. “People are worried and cannot tolerate all the crimes that have lately occurred. The whole neighbourhood is frustrated and some have the feeling that they are not receiving enough protection from (the authorities) – neither police, nor political institutions.”
