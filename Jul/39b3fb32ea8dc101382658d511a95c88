It was a case of a four-year-old meeting a 69-year-old elder and exchanging birthday gifts when the EFF’s top brass met King Goodwill Zwelithini yesterday. The leadership of the EFF, which turned four on Wednesday, paid a visit to the Zulu king at his Lindu Zulu Royal Palace in the traditional capital of Nongoma on the day he turned 69, led by its leader, Julius Malema. “These included four cows which they (the EFF) said are pregnant, and a bull. “As is custom, the king also gave them a beast, which they took away,” said the king’s brother and royal house spokesperson Prince Mbonisi Zulu. The king had some words of advice for members of the young party, who are known for being rabble-rousers in Parliament. “He spoke to them as a parent and emphasised the need for respect. “It should be remembered that the Zulu nation is known for respect and, as the custodian of that, the king had to talk about respect.” He told the EFF members that all political leaders had to behave in a dignified manner as their actions had a bearing on how the country was viewed. “He told them that all of us have to work towards building a prosperous South Africa and that requires politicians to be constructive.” The prince emphasised that the king was apolitical and had hosted leaders of other political parties at his palaces in the past. The EFF has been criss-crossing KwaZulu-Natal garnering support ahead of its birthday celebration rally to be held at the Currie’s Fountain Stadium tomorrow. Malema’s visit to the king earned him praise from Twitter users. @MuhaliCalvin tweeted: “Salute leadership; we respect old people because of their behaviour, not because of age.” @PrinceTjotjo said: “Well done to EFF, we salute.” @kgaugelo_N, who was less happy, tweeted: “The Zulu King benefits unfairly from taxpayers’ money even though some of us don’t subject ourselves to traditional leaders. “When the EFF comes into power, it will change such allocations of taxpayers’ money.”
