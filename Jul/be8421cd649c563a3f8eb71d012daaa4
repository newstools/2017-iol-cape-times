The site is located on the corner of Pickwick and Copperfield roads. Mayoral committee member for transport and urban development Brett Herron describes the transitional housing as “safe, decent and affordable temporary housing” for those facing emergency situations to bring them as close as possible to their workplace. The Pickwick Transitional Housing Project is the first development to provide transitional housing in the inner city. “Those living in the facility will sign lease agreements and pay monthly rent based on what they can afford. The city will subsidise the operational costs through its Rental Indigent Scheme applicable to council tenants,” Herron said. Beneficiaries are expected to be able to relocate to the temporary housing by the end of this year. “One of the city’s social housing partners will commence with the development,” he said. Mayor Patricia de Lille said the estimated cost is R11.1million to develop the project “which will include access control to ensure the safety of those residing there". “We are also investigating the feasibility of developing further inclusionary housing projects in other parts of the city. In taking our work to the next level, I am pleased to also share a key highlight of the past month which was indeed a first for Cape Town and the country,” she said.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
