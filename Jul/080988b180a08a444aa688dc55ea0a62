Residents had protested against what they call a spike in gang violence in the area. The shooting happened about 5.30pm, an hour and a half after the solidarity march ended. The incident occurred outside a well-known liquor outlet in Lysander Street in Factreton. “We are devastated and saddened by this news, especially after marching on that very street just hours before the incident,” said Kensington resident Rahima Matthews. Residents said the flare up of shootings was between rival gangs in Kensington after an alleged American gang member Faiek Rhode was killed last month. Kensington CPF secretary Cheslyn Steenberg said: “Because of this incident, residents now fear what is next. It is so wrong and again we are being held hostage in our homes. This should not become a norm for us. “The CPF calls upon residents that could have seen anything to inform the police. The only way to curb crime is if the community works alongside SAPS.” The community also called for more resources and vehicles to be made available to the local police station, as residents described the ratio of officer per person as around one to 11 000. “This incident once again reiterates the need for visible policing in order to prevent such incidents from occurring.” Residents said they experienced daily shootings around 10pm and feared that innocent people would be caught in the crossfire. Police said circumstances around the shooting were being investigated and no one had been arrested.
