NSRI St Francis Bay duty crew were activated  following the chokka fishing boat Silver Explorer reporting that a member on board was suffering a seizure,  said NSRI St Francis Bay station commander Sarah Smith. “Silver Explorer was heading towards the port of St Francis from Kabaljous and just prior to our sea rescue craft Spirit of St Francis II arriving, the skipper said his crew member had died. On arrival NSRI medics were put aboard the Silver Explorer and confirmed the fisherman was deceased.” Two more  people have drowned in two separate incidents - one in the Western Cape and the other in KwaZulu-Natal at the weekend. NSRI Mykonos duty crew were activated just before 8pm on Friday following reports of a man missing after a boat capsized at Voorstrand, Paternoster, north of Cape Town. NSRI Mykonos deputy station commander Morne Dettmer said the crayfish bakkie (a small open fishing boat) was believed to have capsized with three local adult men on board. Two  of them managed to swim ashore and raised the alarm. The sea rescue craft Gemini Rescuer II was launched, with the SAPS and traffic service officers also in attendance. “During a search the head lamp of the missing fisherman was located and recovered, but despite an extensive search no sign of the missing man has been found. The boat was found washed up on the beach. “On Saturday, only one oar confirmed to be from the boat was recovered,” Dettmer said. In northern KwaZulu-Natal, NSRI Richards Bay duty crew were activated about 3pm on Saturday following reports of a drowning in progress at Bay Hall.  NSRI Richards Bay station commander Dorian Robertson said: “NSRI rescue swimmers responded. On arrival two females had been assisted from the water by bystanders after difficulty while swimming." A child, believed to be 11, was assisted by bystanders. NSRI medics commenced CPR on a woman, 19. She was later declared dead.
