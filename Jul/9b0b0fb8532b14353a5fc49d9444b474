Last week the ANC’s NWC visited all the six regions of the Western Cape, listening to party regional leaders following objections to a decision by the provincial executive to disband the Dullah Omar region because of factionalism and gatekeeping, among other issues. The Dullah Omar regional executive was replaced by a regional task team, headed by ANC MP Leonard Ramatlakane. An ANC insider described the meeting as “very rough”. “Some of the NWC members came out very rough against President Jacob Zuma. “The gloves are off,” he said. At the heart of the disbanding of Dullah Omar region is control of the delegates which will represent their branches at the December elective conference. While the Western Cape will make up one of the smaller delegations from the nine provinces, which are expected to be in the region of 300, supporters of both Dlamini Zuma and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa are fighting for control over who will make it to the conference. A  member of the ANC’s provincial executive (PEC) confirmed yesterday that the meeting was “quite heated”. NWC members such as Nomvula Mokonyane and Fikile Mbalula were calling for the provincial executive to be disbanded. “But only the national executive committee can make that decision, so for now the regional task team will continue with its work,” said the PEC member. ANC insiders said the issue of acting provincial chairperson Khaya Magaxa was also discussed when the NWC met the PEC on Monday. Magaxa indicated to the NWC that he wanted to step down from his acting role. He wants the provincial general council to elect a new chairperson. Magaxa was recently elected on to the central committee of the SA Communist Party, which has indicated that it  would consider contesting future elections under its own banner. ANC spokesperson Khusela Sangoni said it would not comment on the outcome of the NWC meeting.
