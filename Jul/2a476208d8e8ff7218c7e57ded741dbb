Trade and Industry Minister and SACP central committee member Rob Davies backs the party’s decision to contest elections separate from the ANC. “It was an important decision – and I was part of it,” Davies said.  “It is a given that the SACP will contest polls in the future,” he said. He said an assessment would have to be made by the central committee and that this would be set out at a special national congress next year. But some political analysts have accused the SACP of “brinkmanship” Political analyst Professor Dirk Kotze of Unisa said the decision was based on the outcome of the ANC elective conference in December. “In closet language, it says if (Deputy President Cyril) Ramaphosa wins, we are not going on our own. If he doesn’t win, we will go on our own.” He said the decision was a tactical move by the party, and the political space on the left wing was overcrowded. “It involves Saftu (South African Federation of Trade Unions of Zwelinzima Vavi), the EFF and the Black Consciousness Movement.” Political analyst Bheki Mngomezulu said the SACP’s talk of leaving the alliance was a threat “to test the waters, as they can’t survive on their own”.
