The ANC wants people with the best brains to occupy senior and managerial positions in the SABC and other state-owned entities in order to restore the integrity of the government. This was the view of the ANC policy committee on communications, headed by Jackson Mthembu, when reacting to questions from journalists about possible criminal actions against those accused of defrauding the public broadcaster of millions of rand.The comments came as Parliament was undertaking measures to restore integrity in state-owned entities like the SABC and SAA. Last week, 11 members of the SAA board failed to appear before the parliamentary committee on finance, apparently in protest against the presence of chairperson Dudu Myeni. Myeni, according to insiders, has been accused of undermining her fellow board members. At the SABC former chief operations officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng was shown the door, while former acting chief executive James Aguma faces disciplinary action.Other state-owned entities like Eskom and Denel were implicated in then-public protector Thuli Madonsela s &quot;State of Capture&quot; report.Deputy Telecommunications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams said they had decided to await the outcome of the investigations conducted by the SABC interim board into corruption at the SABC and would support any recommendations for criminal investigations. We do not approve of any acts of corruption, Ndabeni-Abrahams said. Mthembu, however, was more direct on the need to act against corruption, saying the SABC should immediately begin a process of head hunting people with the best brains to replace people like Motsoeneng and Aguma. But it should not be only for the SABC, it must also apply to other state-owned entities. The lack of best brains has been our (ANC's) Achilles heel. If we can t get the best brains here we must go to other countries to find them, Mthembu said.
