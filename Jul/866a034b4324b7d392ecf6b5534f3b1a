Well, the BBC’s Come Dine With Me has made that a reality and for years has given viewers a chance to witness the shenanigans of contestants and their cuisines. The hit show is set for for another local season, with Come Dine With Me SA promising more laughs, food and fun. South African actress, presenter, model, entrepreneur and fashion blogger Shashi Naidoo participated in the show in 2011. She was joined at the time by sportscaster Neil Andrews, TV presenter Ashley Hayden, and radio host Sam Cowen, who cooked for each other in the name of charity. Although Naidoo didn’t win the grand prize of R10 000 for the charity of her choice, she looks back on the experience with fond memories. “It’s quite a thing eating out and drinking for four nights in a row and then taking four more days to just recover,” she joked. Naidoo said that on the night she hosted the other celebrity participants, she made a “Tom Yum Goong” starter, a Japanese-inspired salmon for her main course and chocolate mousse for dessert. “When I was on the show we competed for charity, so it wasn’t as competitive and we had so much fun,” she said. Naidoo’s sentiments were echoed by another former contestant, Jodi Deerling, who described his time on the show as "amazing". The fashion designer said the reality series is not just about food but also entertainment. “I’m not a big cook but I know how to entertain,” he said. “When I hosted, I had a theatrical theme and even had items such as a red carpet at the entrance.” His advice to those who want to participate is simple: “Be different and have an element of surprise.” The return of Come Dine With Me SA on DStv’s BBC Lifestyle comes after a three year hiatus.
