Now in its fourth year, the festival will feature a lot more local artists, both established and upcoming, with their home-grown concept and production. “When we approached Proudly South African earlier this year to become partners, they automatically assumed our festival was an international model imported into South Africa,” said festival director Lloyd Cornwall. They started talking to the brand after Proudly South African realised the festival had its roots firmly in South Africa. This is the first time an event has become a member company of the Proudly South African "buy local" campaign. “In addition to the event providing two days of family entertainment, the business end of the festival is what impressed us as a campaign,” said Proudly South African chief executive Eustace Mashimbye. For this year’s festival, the organisers have worked their way through Proudly South African’s database of members to procure as much as they can from those companies that are part of and support the buy local campaign. “The event represents millions of rand in local procurement and is a significant creator of jobs directly and indirectly, which is the key message we preach - buy local to create jobs. The DStv Delicious Festival team is living this message,” Mashimbye said. The festival will be held at the Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit on October 7 and 8.
