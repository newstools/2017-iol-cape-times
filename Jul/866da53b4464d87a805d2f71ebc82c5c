Cape Town - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to the Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA) to request that the disciplinary inquiry into Bell Pottinger set for 18 August 2017 in London, be open to the public. This inquiry comes after the DA’s complaint that the PR firm violated the PRCA's Code of Conduct. The DA stated that the hearing should be open to all those who wish to attend.  "We have been informed by the PRCA that they will raise the issue with Bell Pottinger. The 'all parties' also refers to the disciplinary committee and PRCA has therefore also requested permission from committee members as well," the opposition party said in a statement. "If Bell Pottinger is truly sorry for the damage they have done to race relations in our country by their divisive campaign, they will accede to the DA's request." The DA believes that all citizens must be permitted to witness the process, as they were the ones that "suffered the consequences" of Bell Pottinger’s, the ANC as well as the actions of the Guptas.
