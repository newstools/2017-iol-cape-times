The leadership of the ANC’s Lower South Coast region on Monday appealed for calm from its members, following the decision by the provincial leadership of the ANC to strip the region of some of its powers. On Sunday, the provincial executive committee (PEC) of the party announced that some powers were being taken away from the regional executive committee (REC) and some functions would now be performed by a task team that has been put in place. Mzwandile Mkhwanazi, secretary in the region, urged members to co-operate with the task team despite saying that the region was not given a fair and reasonable opportunity to test the veracity of allegations made against it. Some of the allegations which led to the PEC’s decision are that some regional leaders had manipulated party processes and membership in the run-up to the local government elections. But Mkhwanazi said the ANC’s showing in the region during the local government election last year was proof that the regional leadership had acted in the best interests of the party. On Sunday, angry members protested outside the Uvongo Town Hall against the PEC’s decision. At a meeting with the provincial leaders, some branch representatives also voiced concern. “The PEC did indicate to the branches that they could exercise their right to appeal this decision within the processes as allowed by the ANC,” said Mkhwanazi. Sources within the region said the decision would be appealed. They argued that the region was being targeted because the majority of its leaders were backing ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa to become the next ANC  president. The ANC has denied its decision had anything to do with the upcoming elective  conference. Without specifically mentioning the succession debate, Mkhwanazi said the region would ensure open and frank discussion on any issue affecting the ANC. “It is a normal part of a democratic organisation such as the ANC to have differing views on issues," he said.
