They went to identify her body after yesterday s proceedings.Before proceedings, residents along with Camron s netball teammates were prevented from entering the court for fear that they would disrupt proceedings.Wearing a grey and black jacket, his hair slicked back with blond highlights, Rubain appeared calm and smiled at family in the gallery.State prosecutor Chloe Morris told the court: &quot;On the night of July 2, the suspect lured the victim away from a community bonfire under the pretence that her father sent him to collect her.&quot;Witnesses saw him leave with her, other accounts place him with the victim and another leaving the scene of the crime on the morning of the discovery. Morris said while Rubain was technically a first-time offender, he had a charge of sexual assault withdrawn in 2015.
