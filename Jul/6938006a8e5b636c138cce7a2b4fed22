Cape Town - Police say they are looking for a dreadlocked motorist who shot and killed a man who tried to rob him at a notorious smash-and-grab hotspot on the Cape Flats. According to a witness, the unknown driver simply said “f*** him” and drove off after shooting the 34-year-old alleged robber from Kalksteenfontein. Witness Elizabeth Kleinsmith, who is also a member of the Bishop Lavis Neighbourhood Watch, says the incident occurred on Tuesday night at the Jakkalsvlei Avenue and Valhalla Drive intersection, a known hotspot for smash-and-grabs. “It was before 8pm and I was walking to my friend’s house. I saw the guys standing in the gangetjie (alley). They always jump out of there and smash the windows and steal from the cars that stand at the robot. I shouted at them to leave the cars alone,” says Kleinsmith. She says moments later she saw two men approach a maroon Mazda 3, which was driven by a man with dreadlocks and a female passenger. She heard the woman scream and then saw the driver get out. “Toe hoor ek twee skote (Then I heard two gunshots) and [the robbers] ran away. I went to the car and the woman was screaming, I asked her if she was OK and he (the driver) said ‘ja, she is fine’." “I went to the driver and said: ‘You shot that guy’. He just turned and said ‘f*** him’. Then he drove off. When I turned I saw the one guy didn’t make it back to the gangetjie (alley) and was lying there bleeding; toe is hy dood (he was dead.).” Kleinsmith says she and another resident, Natasha Petersen, followed the man in Petersen’s car as he sped away and drove in the direction of Parow. “He jumped all the robots and we lost him,” says Petersen. Police and ambulance were called to the scene. Police spokesperson, Sergeant Leon Fortuin, confirms the incident and says the deceased was shot in the neck and side. “The male died on the scene. A murder case has been opened for investigation. No arrests have been made at this stage,” said Fortuin. Daily Voice
