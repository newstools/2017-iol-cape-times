The Elders spokesperson William French said: “The choice of (venue) comes from the story of resilience of this community, who rebuilt their lives after the suffering they faced during apartheid.” French said The Elders valued working together in a spirit of solidarity, compassion and tolerance. The Elders at the event were Graça Machel, Martti Ahtisaari, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Hina Jilani, Ricardo Lagos and Mary Robinson. Richard Branson also attended as a member of The Elders’ advisory council. The UN in South Africa handed over much-needed wheelchairs, blankets and other items to pupils while also “lending a hand” revamping classrooms at the Adelaide Tambo School for the physically challenged in Soweto. In a fun twist on Mandela Day, Adventure Clubs will be contributing their 67 Minutes at Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, in a joyous chorus of colourful busking, to raise money for music development for underprivileged children. Over 67 children and their parents will gather in Kirstenbosch’s lower courtyard, and will learn how to do the Madiba Shuffle and will participate in a massive djembe drum jam session led by local drummer Sebastian Guile. The busking will be the build up to a heart-warming Happy Birthday tribute song to Madiba with the crowd of children waving brightly-coloured ribbon wands, before ending the final minutes with a grand rendition of the South African national anthem.
