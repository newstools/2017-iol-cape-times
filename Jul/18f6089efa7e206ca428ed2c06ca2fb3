Yesterday was an emotional day for the family of the little boy who has touched hearts throughout the country in his brave battle against cancer. At a Spur in Mitchells Plain, he was blessed with birthday wishes and played with friends. He had turned 8 on Saturday. In June 2015 doctors gave him just three months to live after he was diagnosed with stage four cancer. His only hope was expensive treatment not available in state hospitals. Thanks to donations from readers, friends, supporters and his school, Hazeldene Primary, more than R150 000 was raised for treatment. However, in February this year Junaid’s family was told he had weeks to live as the cancer had returned. But Junaid continues to beat the odds. His grandmother Margaret Arendse said: “(I told Junaid) The Lord, he is the one that let you live till 8 years old now and further on. "You’re not going to live just till 8, but you will live till 40, 45, 60. Then he says ‘okay Ma’ and he kisses me on my cheek and he says ‘yes Ma, I believe I’m going to live on’.” “Healthwise, he is A-for-away. He's not lying sick. He plays every day, and you won’t say he is on morphine. I don’t see him lying in pain.” His mother, Monique Arendse, said: “Junaid has reached his 8th birthday. It is through God’s grace.”
