Estate agent and member of the Institute of Estate Agents of South Africa Joy Macnab said that the township property market was the fastest-growing market but “there seemed to be one set of norms for townships and a different set for suburban areas”. Macnab said the lack of compliance with court-granted evictions following repossessions amounted to flouting the law. “People in the townships do not vacate repossessed houses when the sheriff goes out to execute the eviction order, the whole community comes out to protest and that leaves the new owner paying for a house they can not live in and the occupants living 
in the house rent free,” she said. Estate agent Zola Makhula said he would not advise people to sell repossessed homes in the townships. “The agents don’t tell the potential buyers the whole truth,” he said.  asanda.sokanyile@inl.co.za  Weekend Argus
