IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has hit back at the ANC in northern KwaZulu-Natal, accusing them of manufacturing allegations of corruption against one of its mayors to shield their own corruption. Buthelezi was speaking at a party rally in Glencoe, where he told supporters that millions of rand had been spent in Umzinyathi district municipality in “dodgy contracts” and “fraudulent procurement practises”. The IFP took control of the district after victory in the Nquthu by-elections in May, giving the IFP control of Umzinyathi district after five years. Buthelezi said Umzinyathi district mayor Petros Ngubane, who was inaugurated last month, had identified millions of rand of irregular expenditure. “Some R3 million was spent on water tanks, but there are still communities who have no access to water. (Another) R22m was spent on operations and maintenance.” Last week, the ANC tabled a motion of no confidence against Endumeni mayor Siboniso Mbatha following allegations of corruption. He in turn blamed ANC councillors for not enabling the committee to table the report.
