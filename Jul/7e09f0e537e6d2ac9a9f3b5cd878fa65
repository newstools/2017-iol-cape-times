Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has reiterated his widely stated support for the establishment, without delay, of a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture, but cannot himself establish such an inquiry, the presidency said on Saturday.
 
Therefore, Ramaphosa opposed the application in which AfriForum, the Quaker Peace Centre, and the FW de Klerk Foundation were asking the Constitutional Court to order Ramaphosa to establish a commission of inquiry into the allegations of state capture, his spokesperson Tyrone Seale said.
 
"Deputy President Ramaphosa opposes this application based on his understanding that the Constitution does not permit the deputy president to exercise presidential powers," he said.
