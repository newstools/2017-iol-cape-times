There is still no end in sight to the ongoing impasse between the Home Affairs Department and the workers union over unpaid weekend shifts. Disgruntled workers have vowed to stay away from work on Saturdays until the department resolves to pay them. Meanwhile, unions and the department were still locked in talks to find a solution to the labour dispute, which has led to the suspension of operations at Home Affairs offices countrywide on Saturdays. For a second weekend, the offices in Pretoria were closed on Saturday as officials didnâ€™t show up for work. According to the department, the closure of offices at weekends would remain until an agreement was reached. Spokesperson Bongiwe Gambu said the department was hopeful that the ongoing negotiations would result in a positive outcome.
