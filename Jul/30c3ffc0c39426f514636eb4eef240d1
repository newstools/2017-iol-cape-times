On Sunday a roof collapsed in one of the rooms of the building. Residents believe this was prompted by heavy rain that morning. Resident Delia Adrian, 65, said: “This guy (the landlord), for the time that I have lived here, he has only been in this building twice. He talks about revamping the place,  but he’s never done a thing.” When she owed R3 000 on her rent, she says her landlord, who is only known as “Baboo Patel”, evicted her. “I’m scared (of living in this building), but finding a place for a family of seven is not easy. I moved from District Six, and now it’s almost as if history is repeating itself,” said Adrian. “Every resident renting in Woodstock, in Cornwall Street, in Hofmeyr Lane is feeling insecure because they know what is happening here will happen to them eventually,” said Adrian. Yesterday afternoon they braved the cold along Searle Street in Woodstock, picketing to bring attention to their struggle for housing. Adrian said landlords in Woodstock did not see their tenants as human beings. “They see us as currency, rands and cents, and dollars because they sell all these properties to the foreigners who come from overseas who push the poor out,” said Adrian. Her long-time neighbour, Faghmeeda Ling, said residents would not leave without a fight. They will be back at the Western Cape High Court tomorrow to fight against their eviction after they were handed notices in March. They want reasonable accommodation in Woodstock, saying they have nowhere else to go. Corporate services mayoral committee member Raelene Arendse said the city had been liaising with Legal Aid, specifically with regards to the request for alternative accommodation following the eviction proceedings by the landlord. She said all requests for alternative accommodation must follow due process.
