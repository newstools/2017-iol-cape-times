The University of Witwatersrand (Wits), has awarded South Africa’s business leader and entrepreneur Jabu Mabuza with an Honorary Doctorate recognising him of his achievements in entrepreneurship and contribution towards the growth of the South African economy. Mabuza is currently the President of Business Unity South Africa (BUSA), Chairman of BLSA, Executive Chairman of Sphere Holdings, Chairman of Telkom, as well as Chairman of the Africa portion of the merged Anheuser-Busch InBev and SAB Miller. “Mabuza is an accomplished business leader who has contributed immensely towards business leadership and growing the South African economy. It is, therefore, befitting that he is awarded an Honorary Doctorate from one of South Africa’s leading Universities,” said BUSA Chief Executive Officer Tanya Cohen. BUSA said that the award demonstrates the high-calibre of business leaders that South Africa is capable of producing. “We congratulate Dr Jabu Mabuza. We are very proud of what he has accomplished and we are very honoured and privileged to have someone of his calibre as the President of BUSA,” Cohen said.  BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
