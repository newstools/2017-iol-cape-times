Thabiso Jada was travelling in a Brackenfell train when security guards accused him of drinking alcohol after finding an empty beer bottle next to him. “It was not mine. They then forced me to say that I was drinking. I refused, so they kept me in holding for three hours and demanded R40 as a fine. I still refused, so they took my two cellphones and browsed them, including my WhatsApp. "They searched me, found my wallet and took R100 out of it to purchase this R40 fine ticket,” he said. The guards allegedly pushed him out of the train after he refused to take the ticket. Jada said he went to the police, but was told to lodge a complaint with the train station’s management. “When I got there, I was told the manager was not on duty and I should go to Thornton station instead. When I got there, that manager was also off,” he said. Approached for comment, Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said: “I have referred this incident to the investigating team, and will revert once the outcome is provided."
