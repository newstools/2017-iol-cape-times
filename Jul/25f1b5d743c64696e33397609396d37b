The forum believes the move was linked to an earlier incident where councillor Antonio van der Rheede found out about a recruitment done by the forum for the City’s safety and security department. They said Van der Rheede had told told them nothing was done without his approval. Van der Rheede has rejected the allegations, saying it was unfortunate the forum had chosen to take a process affecting many different organisations, to create the impression that they were being targeted. The organisations were providing life skills training, youth diversion, crime prevention, women support groups, neighbourhood watch and other community development services. In a letter, the forum said the facilities belonged to the community and Van der Rheede had no right to evict them without reasons. “Our rights are being violated by one man. Why should the community be affected by the decisions of a warmonger?” they said. “Our councillor is a gatekeeper. He has made it impossible for the community to participate in issues that directly affect them. “We call on mayor Patricia De Lille to urgently intervene and call the councillor to order. We also believe he is targeting our organisations because they are run by women,” said the forum. Van der Rheede said the forum should follow proper channels to raise concerns about his conduct.
