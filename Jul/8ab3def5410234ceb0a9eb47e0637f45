Three weeks ago, he says he wrote a letter to the ANC's national executive, saying the disciplinary process against him was procedurally flawed. Fransman’s name recently came up when the ANC's Dullah Omar (Cape Town metro) region was disbanded by the party's provincial executive committee. ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs blamed factionalism and gate-keeping for the decision to dissolve the Dullah Omar regional executive. Fransman, who was handed his  suspension in April, was accused by the ANC's provincial executive of continuing to “misrepresent” himself as “provincial chairperson” even though his former deputy Khaya Magaxa is now acting in his stead. Fransman said slate politics, where people were elected into positions, not due to leadership abilities, but due to which slate they belonged to, contributed to the ANC's woes. He didn't blame the unpopularity of President Jacob Zuma, mired in numerous scandals for the ANC's loss of three metros, and many smaller municipalities to minority coalitions in last year's local government elections. The ANC's percentage of the vote in the City of Cape Town dropped to 24% from 32% in 2011. Fransman said he was blamed for the ANC's woes in the Western Cape when Jacobs should bear responsibility for some of the processes leading up to last year's local government elections. He was adamant that he was targeted for expulsion from the ANC because he stood up, at an NEC meeting in September 2015, to expose a “regime change agenda" hatched at a popular Green Point restaurant. “They were putting together a plan, with businessmen in Joburg, to take down...individuals in the ANC that would be aligned to President Zuma,” said Fransman. He said they also wanted to get rid of him as Western Cape chairperson.
