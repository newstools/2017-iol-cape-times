Johannesburg - The Department of Home Affairs on Friday advised citizens of the closure of its offices this weekend. This after the department last month issued an apology for the inconvenience caused due to the closure of most of its offices on June 24, 2017. The department, at the time, confirmed over 90% of its offices were not operational on that Saturday due to an insufficient number of staff members turning up for work. This despite a nationwide strike by disgruntled workers being averted at the last minute after the department and trade unions struck a deal that allowed Home Affairs workers to go back to voluntary work on Saturdays. Home affairs in a statement said its offices will remain closed on Saturday July 15, 2017.
 
"The Minister of Home Affairs, Professor Hlengiwe Mkhize, continues to appeal to members of the public to be patient while the Department is working on resolving the matter as quickly as possible and apologises for any inconvenience caused." IOL
