Cape Town - A Cape Flats community is begging authorities for help after their quiet neighbourhood was hit 20 times by crowbar gangs in just one month. In the latest incident on Wednesday, a gang broke into a house in Second Street, Welcome Estate, where they got away with two televisions, a tablet and a smartphone. The residents of the targeted house were not at home on Thursday when the Daily Voice arrived. A 12-year-old neighbour who witnessed the robbery tells Daily Voice the suspects wore black clothing and drove a silver car. “Two guys just came running out of the house and jumped into their silver Hyundai i10. There was lots of money on the seat and there was another man waiting in the driver’s seat.” The boy’s grandpa says they got quite a fright and called police. “It’s putrid; 10111 was called, but the police didn’t show up.” The boy’s grandmother now fears for his life after he witnessed the robbery. “We are scared to go out, we can’t go anywhere. My house was broken into four times, so that fear is in me,” the grandmother says. “I was scared for my grandson, he was very frantic when we got home. I told him now the people know you and you can’t remember them.” Salim Orrie of the Welcome Estate Neighbourhood Watch says the neighbourhood has become a hotspot for crowbar gangs. “In May, we had 20 crowbar-related incidents in Vanguard and Welcome Estate. “In June it didn’t subside and now in July, we have had about five incidents so far,” he says. Orrie says the gang targets homes without visible security. “They are in and out in four to five minutes. They usually force their way in through the front door by breaking the door handle and lock. “Their getaway cars have false number plates so that they slip in and out undetected. “We want to get cameras in the area as a deterrent to stop these robberies. We are working with the City, but we still need more funding to make it happen,” he adds. Daily Voice  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
