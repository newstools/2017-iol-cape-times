JOHANNESBURG - The City of Cape Town on Monday urged residents to not use more water when it rains, saying it expected a “tough” summer ahead. The  dam storage levels are at 26.4 percent but usable water is only at about 16.4 percent, which is low for this time of the year, the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Informal Settlements, Water and Waste Services; and Energy, Xanthea Limberg said. “It is clear from our water usage figures that many consumers continue to be influenced by the weather — whether it be cold and rainy or dry and hot in the summer. This is part of the challenge of the behaviour change path that we are currently on,” Limberg said. “We will have those users who wrongly believe that a bit of rain will lift us out of the drought. Similarly, we’ll have those who fight and resist the water restrictions and usage limits. The fact remains that we do not have a choice. We must save water while we still have it. We are expecting a tough summer ahead.” Limberg said the collective water usage was 613 million litres per day, 113 million litres above the new target of 500 million litres of collective water usage under Level 4b water restrictions. She said the restrictions were in place despite the rainfall and winter weather conditions. The City requires all water users to use less than 87 litres of water per person per day in total, irrespective of whether they are at home, work or elsewhere, she said. “Warning letters are currently being sent to exorbitant users. If they fail to act or to justify their high usage, water supply to their properties will be restricted.” – African News Agency (ANA)
