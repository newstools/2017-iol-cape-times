Despite our progress made in creating safe spaces for women and girls, we continue to live in fear and be victims of crime and abuse. This was one of the most important topics discussed at the Durban College girls' conference. We as Rock Girls were invited to speak about the daily challenges we face and how we get through them. Many strong women and girls spoke that day. There were a few topics that really stood out for me, like listening to one of the women who was raped by four men in front of her father. Justice was served because she went straight from the scene where it happened to get help at one of the rape crisis centres. Besides a rape examination, she was given medication that will prevent her from getting HIV or other STIs in case the perpetrators were infected. It was also easy for the law to find these guys because she was able to provide enough evidence. We mostly say that the law fails us but do we really know why? In order for justice to be served we need to provide evidence. In order to help the police, a rape victim needs to: not bathe when you have been raped, not urinate, not tamper with the evidence – like changing the clothes that you wore during the incident or removing things that were at the scene during the time of rape. You can still get justice; don't wait, report the case immediately. Remember “No” is “No” and “Yes” is a “Yes”. There are a few places you can go to when you have been raped. You can go to the police station and they will take you to the doctor to get examined for the proof you have been raped or assaulted. Other options include your nearest rape crisis centre, which can contact the police and doctors on your behalf. They also provide counsellors who help you immediately.  Rape Crisis Centre can be contacted on: 021 447 9762.
