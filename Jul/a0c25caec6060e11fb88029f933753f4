And for Women’s Month, the five-a-side football brand organises its second annual 5v5 tournament to celebrate female empowerment. As a way to promote women’s soccer in South Africa, the charity event is to be held on August 18, at the Grand Central rooftop facility. All the proceeds will be going to the Girls and Football SA Charity. Cohen acknowledged that football remained a male-dominated sport. He praised the power of the game in fostering growth as well as development in people from all walks of life. He said encouraging girls and women to participate in sports tournaments is likely to contribute positively to their place within society. He also highlighted the need to change the stereotypes that still revolve around soccer. “By changing the stereotype that football is a male-orientated game, we are naturally promoting gender equality and opening everyone to the benefits of this beautiful game,” said Cohen. The brand already piloted a similar tournament last year, which appeared to be a great success. “Football is a sport that breaks down barriers, builds communities and promotes life skills”, he added. Fives Futbol seeks to sustainably promote gender equality by establishing soccer  as a sport that women play all year round, and not only for Women’s Month. “We want to use Women’s Month as a platform to leverage and promote the female game as there is so much unlocked potential to use football to empower women and encourage equality”, said Cohen.
