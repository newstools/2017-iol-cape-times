In another incident, an armed robber was found hiding in a fridge in Vredenburg yesterday. Police say members of Vredenburg Detective Services were conducting a tracing operation in Louwville for a wanted criminal at a premises in Oxford Road, Louwville, Vredenburg. “At about 6.30am the members approached the house and were informed by an occupant of the house that the person they are looking for is not staying at that address,” Van Wyk said. The detectives, who were in possession of a warrant of arrest, entered the house and started with their search. “That is when they opened the fridge door and found the armed robber hiding in the fridge.” The 29-year-old suspect, who was wanted for an armed robbery case that occurred in February 2016, appeared in court yesterday.
