The two shootings took place in Gamtoos Weg and Heideveld on Tuesday. A  20-year-old man was shot in the head in Manenberg, on Tuesday at 1.30pm, according to police. According to sources, the man was shot with a gun fitted with a silencer. Police spokesperson Sinathi Joni said another murder docket was registered after a 28-year-old man was shot in Heideveld on the same day. Manenberg Crisis Forum chairperson Roegshanda Pascoe said: “The past weekend, the brother of a gangster, affiliated to the Dixie Boys, was shot and killed. The recent shooting in Manenberg comes as a retaliation shooting from the rival gangs,” Pascoe said. Pascoe believes the violence will continue “because the law isn't being enforced in our community”. “Why does a different set of rules exist for Manenberg, Mitchells Plain, Lavender Hill and other gang-ridden areas? These gangsters are keeping our residents hostage. "The people in Manenberg want to live peacefully and deserve to live decently,” she said. “The only message we have for the community is that they now have to be alert as this will cause further retaliation shootings. "There are five gangs in the area who are currently continuing this warfare,” said Pascoe.
