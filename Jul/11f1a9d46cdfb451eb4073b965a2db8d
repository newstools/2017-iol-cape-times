The 84-year-old was admitted to  the Constantiaberg hospital for lung cancer 10 days ago. Yesterday, he told the Cape Times that  doctors had been giving him medication to treat his cancer. “Hopefully I will be able to go home in the next few days. I have lived a full life, a good long life,” Goldberg said. His son, David Goldberg, said when he visited his father yesterday he was talking but remained quiet most of the time. Long-time friend Timothy Jacobs has called on South Africans to keep Goldberg in their prayers for a speedy recovery. The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation last night wished Goldberg a speedy recovery. “We pray for his health, strength and well-being so he can continue inspiring people through his anecdotes from the past, as well as his reflections on political issues.”
