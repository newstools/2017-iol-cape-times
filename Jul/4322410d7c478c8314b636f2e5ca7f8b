At Garden Cottage, a home for eight women with intellectual disabilities under the auspices of Cape Mental Health, the team of 20 employees left their business suits and high heels behind to don protective white suits and turn themselves into painters, sanders, handymen, decorators and all-round good guys at the Heideveld property on July 18. This is not a one-off event, though, according to Vusi Njozela, the marketing and events co-ordinator for the firm's Cape Town office. They will be taking Garden Cottage under their wing in the near future. This first round of improvements and repair work focused on the rooms in the house. All rooms, the doors and cupboards got a fresh coat of paint. Outside the window frames and security gates were also repainted. The team will be returning later in the month to complete the work, to hang new curtains and fit curtain rails, as well as revamping the entertainment area. When the eight residents came home just after lunch, the air was filled with excitement and anticipation. The Webber Wentzel staff took some time to get to know the women, who brimmed with appreciation. At the handing over of the certificates of appreciation, Ingrid Daniels, director of Cape Mental Health, said: “Cape Mental Health was indeed appreciative of the amazing commitment and effort made by Ms Njozela and the wonderful team who came to make a difference in the lives of the women at Garden Cottage. "The redecoration of the cottage will make more that 67 minutes difference in their everyday lives. The smile on the women's faces spoke a thousand words of thanks.” This investment by the Webber Wentzel team helps us to make community living a reality for people with intellectual disability - a safe, warm and beautiful home.
