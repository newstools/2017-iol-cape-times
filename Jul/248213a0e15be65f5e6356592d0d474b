They say Mayco member for transport and urban development Brett Herron should be commended following his announcement that 10 sites in the city centre, Salt River and Woodstock had been identified for affordable housing. Three of the 10 sites have already been allocated to social housing authorities. They are the development of the Salt River Market in Albert Road, that will provide about 476 affordable housing opportunities; two sites along Pine Road; and six sites along Dillon Lane in Woodstock. The city is also planning its first inner-city transitional housing project in Salt River, and details will be shared once the council approves it on July 27, Herron said. “The proposed development of the Salt River site is only the first; there are more transitional housing projects in the pipeline in Salt River, as well as in other areas in Cape Town. “In fact, our officials are doing an audit of city-owned land parcels in Goodwood and Bellville. We will confirm the locations once we have established that the potential sites are suitable to include transitional housing,” Herron said. Reclaim the City - a Cape Town campaign for desegregation and affordable housing development in the inner city - said Herron’s plan recognised that location mattered. “Councillor Brett Herron committed to using the city’s land to ensure affordable housing is built in well-located areas close to jobs, services and transport. “This is a victory for people being priced out of well-located areas or facing eviction. It shows the power residents have when they organise together to resist injustice and demand change,” they said. Herron said he expected that about 650 000 families earning less than R13 000 a month would rely on the city for assistance between now and 2032.
