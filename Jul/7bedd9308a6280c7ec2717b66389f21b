“The DA can’t compromise on the principle of clean governance just because we want to save coalitions,” the party’s KZN leader, Zwakele Mncwango, said. This follows a motion of no-confidence tabled by the ANC against the municipality’s IFP mayor, Siboniso Mbatha, following allegations of corruption. The DA has indicated it will abstain from voting in this matter. The parties completed a co-operation agreement last year. The DA and the IFP co-operate in eight municipalities in the province. KZN IFP leader Blessed Gwala dismissed the corruption claims, saying the DA had no reason to abstain from the no-confidence vote as the mayor had been cleared in an investigation. “I am warning the DA. If they continue to frustrate us in support of the ANC to ambush the IFP the agreement of co-operation we have with them will suffer nationally,” he said. The ANC's motion of no-confidence alleges that: 1. Mbatha made fraudulent claims in excess of R7 000 for an unauthorised trip using forged documents. 2. He falsely created documents he used to collect donations of up to R10 000 for a cancer association for a trip to England that allegedly did not happen. The ANC resolved that Mbatha be removed as mayor. But Gwala claimed the mayor had been vindicated in an investigation. He blamed a disgruntled IFP member for the allegations. DA leader Zwakele Mncwango said the speaker had been sitting on the report for two months.
