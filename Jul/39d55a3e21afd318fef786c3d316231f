It continues to be open season for super wealthy property buyers in Cape Town s CBD, and there s nothing the municipality can do to regulate it. One of the latest developments in the CBD is The Onyx, by Signatura. Investors will be set back R20million for a penthouse at the Heerengracht Street location, and included in the price is a Jaguar F-Pace SUV. Signatura is a private label property company, which specialises in developing luxury Cape Town apartments. It was founded by property developer John Rabie, founder of the Rabie Property Group.Head researcher at activist organisation and law centre Ndifuna Ukwazi, Hopolang Selebalo, said the effect developments like The Onyx is having on poor and working class households is catastrophic .Selebalo said inclusive growth and development was needed, and the City needs to play a stronger role in regulating the private sector. Exclusive buildings for the super wealthy such as the Onyx are creating a property bubble and driving inequality. The Onyx has nothing to do with lifestyles and everything to do with how homes are being commodified and stripped of their social function. The Onyx will of course raise property prices in the area to unprecedented levels, but Cape Town already has the highest property prices on the continent, Selebalo said.Rabie did not respond to questions by deadline.Mayco member for Transport and Urban Development Brett Herron said the City does not set or influence prices of private property, and its focus is to implement new housing projects for those who require and qualify for state assistance. Higher-end private developments in the inner-city reaffirm the need for the state to ensure the inner-city is accessible and affordable and this is what we plan to do. The City has no influence on regulating market prices, Herron said.
