Acting chairperson of the committee Zukiswa Rantho said yesterday they have written to Duduzane and the Guptas to appear before the inquiry next month. Rantho said: “We first wrote to them to tell them that the committee will call them.” She said a date had not yet been set for the inquiry because of the extra information they keep on receiving about Eskom. “This information has led to us having to put back the date every time. We will see as time goes on which witnesses we will call on specific dates.” The committee will set the dates once it has certainty. The intention of the committee is to look at Eskom following a decision that was taken in May. Initially, the committee had wanted to investigate the decision of Eskom to reinstate Brian Molefe as chief executive. However, the scope was expanded as MPs demanded answers on the coal contracts between Tegeta, a Gupta-owned company, and Eskom. The portfolio committee wanted to get to the bottom of the issues at Eskom, said Rantho. Eskom was also heavily criticised by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) a few months ago over its coal contracts with the Guptas. This followed a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) that the contract was flawed and no proper processes were followed in drawing up the contract. Scopa had also asked Eskom about the real value of the contract. It said the contract was worth R4 billion over a period of 10 years. However, some figures put it at R7bn for the same period. PwC is not the only company that has probed Eskom, as there are six other reports lying around at the power utility on past investigations done. The Special Investigating Unit has also been roped in by the Minister of Public Enterprises, Lynne Brown, to probe Eskom.
