This week the committee will conduct oversight visits to six harbours in the Western Cape as part of its third-term programme. It wants to gain insight into the management of small harbours by the Department of Public Works together with Property Management Trading Entity. The harbours are Stilbaai, Struisbaai, Arniston, Gansbaai, Gordon's Bay and Kalk Bay. In June the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries poured cold water on the City’s plan to take control of some local harbours, saying the council’s proposed by-law for fishing harbours could not supersede the Marine Living Resources Act. The City said it had no choice but to “forge ahead” with its plans, and that it had the power to manage harbours in its jurisdiction as the constitution gave municipalities the “exclusive competence to administer the functional areas listed in Schedule 5, Part B”. - Staff Writer
