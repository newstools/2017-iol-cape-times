The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) on Monday expressed grave concern at the intimidation of journalists by Black First Land First (BLF). In a statement, the SAHRC condemned threats by the BLF to protest at the homes and places of worship of members of the media. A free press is a cornerstone of our constitutional democracy. &nbsp;Any attempt to threaten or intimidate the media is an attack on our democracy and is a violation of our constitution, the commission said. Further, section 15 of the constitution guarantees freedom of religion, belief and opinion. &nbsp;As such, threats by BFLF to protest at places of worship of members of the media, is an infringement of this right. The SAHRC called on the BLF to respect the media s right to operate without fear or favour&quot;, and to immediately stop initimidating and harassing journalists.A group of BLF members, whose organisation is reportedly funded by the Gupta family, marched to Tiso Blackstar editor-at-large Peter Bruce s house in Johannesburg last weekend, demanding that he stop writing about the family. When Business Day editor Tim Cohen arrived at Bruce s house, he was reportedly manhandled by the angry mob.The BLF issued a statement in which it listed other white journalists whom it said were next on their target list. The list included EWN s Stephen Grootes and Barry Bateman, amaBhungane s Sam Sole and News24 columnist Max du Preez. African News Agency
