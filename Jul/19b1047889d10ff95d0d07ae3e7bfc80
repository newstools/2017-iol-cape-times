Police said Peter Masheza was sentenced by the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court to 15 years in jail for robbery and five years for kidnapping to run concurrently. On August 8, 2015, Masheza had asked for a light from the  victim who was dropping off staff  about 9pm at Bosasa temporary housing in Mfuleni. According to police, he pointed a firearm at the victim and drove off with the victim still in the vehicle. Captain FC van Wyk, said: “He drove with the victim around Khayelitsha. The victim was locked in a shack in Khayelitsha and was left there. Masheza, with a female companion, were  arrested in Nyanga by Flying Squad Unit members who were patrolling. “During the trial Masheza tried to pin everything on the companion who  collaborated (sic) his story. However, the magistrate took the woman for a drive as she claimed that she was driving the vehicle. It was proved that she could not drive. She did not even know how to put the vehicle into first gear.” Van Wyk said she told the truth when she learned she had been caught out. Meanwhile, Western Cape Flying Squad members have arrested three suspects in connection with a hijacking in Mfuleni. Van Wyk said the vehicle’s owner was registering a case when members patrolling on Tuesday received information about a vehicle that was hijacked in Nyanga on Monday in Browns Farm. “The complainant was still registering the case when the vehicle was spotted by the police in Mfuleni at Extension 6. The  vehicle was searched. An illegal firearm and some cellphones were found in their possession. “Three males who live in the Philippi and Browns Farm area, aged between 22 and 26, were arrested and charged with possession of a hijacked vehicle and an unlicensed firearm.”
