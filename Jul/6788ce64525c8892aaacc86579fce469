More than 14000 people in the country died on roads last year - a 9% increase over 2015, and the highest annual road death toll since 2007. Some 1210 who died were children, mostly pedestrians. “There is unfortunately a tendency among many people to learn to pass a driving test, rather than to learn to drive competently,” said the AA. “This is counter-productive and ultimately puts drivers on our roads who are certified but not necessarily qualified. “If South Africa is to reduce its staggering annual road death toll, this attitude must change.” The AA said the most important aspect of teaching new drivers was to lead by example, starting from a young age. “Children will replicate behaviour, even bad behaviour, behind the wheel. For this reason it is critical that experienced drivers set a good example by adhering to the rules of the road, including driving with respect.”
