Cape Town - Joey Rasdien has apologised 'unreservedly' to the Muslim community for the comments he made during his slot at the Ilm Arts Festival in Sandton on Saturday. This was after he received flak from Muslims, scholars and the organisers of the festival. Rasdien came under fire for making controversial comments about the companion to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). "As a Muslim comedian I hold myself to the same set of standards expected of a Muslim in any other walk of life. It is our character and behavior that must be unimpeachable. And while humour is a necessary part of our humanity, I understand as well, that the best way for us to humour is to encourage better behviour from all of us. I failed to do this," he said in a statement. Rasdien described the companions of the Prophet as extraordinary and then proceeded to quote the Quran. The comedian has vowed to learn more about the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his companions and to educate himself on the "significance to our understanding of Islam." He expressed deep regret and admitted that if he heard those comments from another comedian, he too would be upset. "I am deeply disappointed in myself and endeavor to do better." "I humbly ask that you join me in beseeching the Most Merciful, to accept my repentance," he added, before he sought forgiveness from Allah. IOL
