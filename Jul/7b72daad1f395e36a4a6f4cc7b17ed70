Police said three people were shot by unknown men. Two of them were wounded while the other, a 28-year-old man, was killed. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said the circumstances of the shooting were being investigated, and no one had been arrested. Ward councillor Franchesca Walker believes the shooting was connected to gang violence in the area. “This has been coming for a while now and is related to drug turf fights. The shootings have especially affected the Leonsdale area, and it makes one fear for the affected communities and children,” said Walker. She added that she considered Leonsdale a “red zone” due to the frequency of shootings. Parow CPF chairperson Roger Cannon said shootings in their area were not common, but there was concern following the latest incident. “This is the first time such an incident occurred in Parow. We are concerned that the shootings are now spilling over from other areas into our community. It definitely does have a negative effect on safety and security. As the CPF we want to ensure the safety of our residents, and want to prevent it from spilling over.” He said although the area did not have a big problem with gangsterism, there was a drug peddling issue. “Due to this being a gang war breaking out due to turf, there is a possibility of it spilling over. However, we will be taking action and I am already in talks with our station commander to address this matter,” Cannon said.
