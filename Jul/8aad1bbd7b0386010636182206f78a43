The group show includes two  projects: iQhiya by Mesatywa and Coloured In by Abrahams. Mesatywa is a 2016 graduate from the Ruth Prowse School of Art and a prizewinner for the top academic essay. When Mesatywa captured the beauty of iqhiya commonly known as a doek or headwrap, she realised she was not just creating an artwork; she was also making a statement to say she was a proud Xhosa woman, who was lesbian and comfortable in her own skin. Artist, writer and lecturer Chad Rossouw mentored her. Abrahams's artwork Coloured In is introspective, exploring the spatial and racial segregation created by the passing of the Group Areas Act under apartheid. It was in this space that he found his identity and that of his 
community. My Identity is curated by Elodye Davids and George Reeves. It will open its doors with a talk by Ernestine White, a Cape Town artist and the curator of contemporary art at Iziko South African National Gallery.  * Visit www.amplifystudio.co for more information. The exhibition will run from Thursday until September 4. Amplify Studio is at 153 Loop Street on the ground floor.
