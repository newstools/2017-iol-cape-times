Muzi Zuma and Chante Herries were crowned first and second princess respectively. The 35-year-old Zhang was part of Miss Gay Ambassador in 2012 and she was one of the four winners. Miss Drag Queen South Africa took place in Cape Town at the weekend. The contestants came from across the country to make it on Von Hamburg's team to a Glam Camp in Stellenbosch in April. Only 32 made it to the semi-finals whittled down to 12 in the finals. Hailing from Mitchells Plain, Zhang had entered the competition to make an “endearing change to society and also to the LGBTI community”. Organisers believed the event would be a vehicle to 
educate communities to respect and show tolerance towards people from diverse sexual orientations, cultural, 
religious and racial backgrounds. The aim of the event was to bring back glamour and entertainment and to highlight issues the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, TransGender and Intersex (LGBTI) community faced. The event was also aimed at  promoting diverse sexual orientations and racial backgrounds and as an agent to bring change and uplift their own communities, the organisers said, and to serve as positive role models to their communities.
