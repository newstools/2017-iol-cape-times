Parliament’s portfolio committee on communications said on Wednesday it had noted the “untimely resignation” of the chief financial officer of the SABC, James Aguma. In a statement, the committee said it would await the reasons of Aguma’s resignation from the SABC interim board. “The committee would have loved for Mr Aguma to stay in order for the disciplinary process to continue so that he can have an opportunity to clear his name.” Aguma's resignation follows his decision to file an urgent court challenge at the Labour Court against his disciplinary hearing, as he was not pleased with the proceedings. He was being charged with breaching his contract and frustrating his employer during the disciplinary hearing of former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. Aguma was known as a close ally of Motsoeneng. He is expected to file a resignation letter later on Wednesday. African News Agency
