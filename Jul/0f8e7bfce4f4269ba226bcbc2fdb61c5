Rubin September, a pupil at Windermere Primary School, was still wearing his uniform when he was hit by a stray bullet and killed on Wednesday night. His body was found yesterday morning by neighbours in 14th Street. Rubin’s mother, Shireen September, said she heard two to three gunshots before 8pm, but didn’t think much of it. “It was early evening, not 8pm yet, when we heard about two to three gunshots go off. "The thought never crossed my mind that anything would happen to my son,” the distraught mother said yesterday. Circumstances surrounding the incident are still under investigation, and no one has yet been arrested, said spokesperson Frederick van Wyk. Rubin's death comes days after Kensington and Factreton residents took to the streets to demonstrate their frustration with increasing gang violence and spate of shootings. Just hours after the march, a man, 26, was killed in an alleged gang shooting.
