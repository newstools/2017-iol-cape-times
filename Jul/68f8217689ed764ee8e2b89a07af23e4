After an hour of protest and negotiations between community leaders and police, Davids was released after paying a R100 admission of guilt fine. Davids admitted he was in possession of dagga when police searched him. “They treated me like it was during the apartheid years. They put the handcuff so tight and the people did not like it and started retaliating.” Resident Leon Marcus said residents saw police as their enemy after a violent protest in 2010 when four people were shot, allegedly by police. That year Hangberg residents pelted police with rocks and petrol bombs when city council workers moved in to break down shacks on a firebreak behind the settlement. “Every time the police come here they harass the community,” said Marcus. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said yesterday police dispersed a group of people and made an arrest. Ward councillor Roberto Quintas said even he was also pelted with stones when he tried to calm residents.
