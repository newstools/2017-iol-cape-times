Bieber has been touring since last year to promote 
his latest album, Purpose 
and, while most of the songs were from this album, he also treated fans to his old hits like Baby. Fans of “Biebs”, as he is commonly known, were a bit underwhelmed by his lack of costume changes during the 90-minute show, and his “lacklustre” energy levels. Another complaint from some angry fans online was that Bieber lip-synced through most of his concert. For his hardcore fans, though, which included some South African celebrities who attended the concert, Bieber’s lip-syncing didn't stop them having fun - and they showed it with pictures posted on Twitter and Instagram. Hardcore Beliebers started queueing from early morning outside Cape Town Stadium to ensure they they got prime seats when the gates eventually opened at 4pm. His concert in Cape Town came as Bieber made history on the British pop charts, being the first artist to replace himself in the No 1 position, not once but twice. Two years ago, Love Yourself replaced Sorry on the charts, and last week he debuted at No 1 as a guest on DJ Khaled’s I’m the One, and also features as a guest on the current No 1 Despacito by Daddy Yankee and Luis Fonsi. Earlier Bieber treated his fans to a live Twitter chat, playing pranks on fellow hotel guests while he was staying at the One&Only at the V&A Waterfront.
