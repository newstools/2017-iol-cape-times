Cape Town – The man accused of kidnapping and murdering 21-year-old Anelisa Dulaze has pleaded guilty to the charges against him on Thursday. Monwabisi Mbobo was sentenced to 5 years for kidnapping and 15 years for the murder of the Rhodes University Drama Student in the Western Cape High Court. He appeared before Judge President John Hlophe. He had murdered Dulaze and buried her in an unfinished house in Makhaza in Khayelitsha last year. Dulaze’s body was found three months after she had gone missing following a night out with friends on January 31. The sentences will run concurrently and Mbobo will spend fifteen years in prison. The state said it had consulted with Dulaze’s family and the investigating officer before the plea was finalised. The state said it had explain to both the family and the investigating officer on how it had reached the agreement with Mbobo's defence team. They were both certified with the agreement. Mbobo confirmed he had agreed to the sentence and was aware of the consequences of the sentence. He said he entered to the plea voluntarily without unduly influenced. He has also been declared not fit to possess a firearm. The sentence against Mbobo came days after Khayelitsha residents commemorate an anniversary since the discovery of Dulaze’s body. Cape Times
