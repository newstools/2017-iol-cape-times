 Manchester – Teenage sweethearts Chloe Rutherford, 17, and Liam Curry, 19, adored each other and wanted to explore the world together. But tragically their decision to leave the concert a few minutes early meant they were caught in the blast. Their parents on Thursday released an emotional joint statement, saying the teenagers from South Shields, South Tyneside, ‘wanted to be together for ever and now they are’. Chloe’s parents Mark and Lisa, both 45, and Liam’s mother Caroline, 46, added: "They were beautiful inside and out to ourselves and our families, and they were inseparable." Chloe’s best friend Amy Ridley said: "Liam was absolutely amazing, the most caring boyfriend Chloe could ever have wished for." "He looked after her so, so much. He was definitely one to keep, I always told her." Liam’s father Andrew Curry, 49, died of cancer last month. Cousin Bernard Hills, 36, said: "That’s why they went to the concert, they’ve been trying to go to places and do things together more, with everything that had gone on." Daily Mail
