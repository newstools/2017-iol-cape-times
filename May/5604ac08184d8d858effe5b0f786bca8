Gugulethu residents protested against the City's plans to develop the Tambo Square informal settlement. The protesting residents say the piece of land should be developed for recreational parks facilities. As a result of the protest, NY 78 and NY 5 remained closed as roads were blocked with burning tyres, rubbish, and rubble during the protests. Pupils of Vukukhanye Primary School have also been prevented from entering the school premises by protesters who have started fires outside the school gates. Saps and Metro police have been monitoring the area and firefighters were putting out fires for most of the day. The protesting residents say they will not stop protesting until their demands are met. Education MEC Debbie Schäfer said she has engaged with the City and police including the Community Safety department to try and ensure full  access to the school. “Communities are free to engage in protest action, but cannot intimidate and prevent learners from going to school. This is grossly unfair and is a practice that needs to stop,” said Schäfer.
