De Klerk, along with fellow former president Thabo Mbeki and former deputy presidents Kgalema Motlanthe and Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka are engaging in a series of dialogues about the state of the country, organised by the foundations of Chief Albert Luthuli, Thabo Mbeki and FW de Klerk. Today's dialogue, the first in the series, takes place at Empire Office Park in Parktown. The Helen Suzman Foundation, the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation, the Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe Foundation, the Umlambo Foundation, and the Jakes Gerwel Foundation have also backed the dialogues.  EFF members walk in and ask where is De Klerk. @IOLPolitics @IOL pic.twitter.com/rFDI6kKOKJ  — Zintle (@ZintleMahlati) May 5, 2017
