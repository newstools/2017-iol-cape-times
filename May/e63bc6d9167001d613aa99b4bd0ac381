“The world is changing we are entering the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the question that faces the leaders of the world both politically and economically is how do we meet this kind of new challenge; what do we do?” Zuma said. Speaking at the Durban ICC during a walkabout at the venue hosting the World Economic Forum on Africa, Zuma said the mindset had to change for Africa not to be left behind. “People talk today about the Fourth Industrial Revolution; it says our thinking must change. I’m saying Africa is placed in a situation where we can stretch our imagination given the fact that it is a developing region.” Zuma said the mere fact that this year’s WEF on Africa had recorded unprecedented attendance figures was a sign that Africa was the place to be for global decision-makers. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is a hot topic at the WEF on Africa gathering being held in Durban until tomorrow. WEF describes the Fourth Industrial Revolution as building on the digital revolution. It is “is characterised by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres”. Speaking on the sidelines of the gathering, Sdumo Dlamini, the president of labour federation Cosatu, said the digital revolution required a new approach to doing things including a constant re-skilling of workers. With continual advancement of technology there was a dire need to develop the skills to catch up. “The plumber of today is not the plumber of two years from now by that time that technology would have changed, so you need to be re-training, re-skilling, it’s a moving target. We are following a moving target and that’s a crisis.” This posed a challenge for workers who might lose jobs to robots unless ways in which workers can benefit were explored, he said.
