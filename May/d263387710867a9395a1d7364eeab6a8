Organised by the Cape Cultural Collective’s (CCC), in collaboration with the SA  Sendinggestig Museum (Slave Church Museum) on Friday, the event was a mix of African music, poetry and dance forms. CCC chairperson Mansoor Jaffer said their organisation was celebrating its 10th anniversary and had an impressive list of projects under its belt, including monthly cultural programmes. “We have grown since our start in 2007 with a focus on arts and culture to create platforms to promote creativity and togetherness, especially in this divided city. Our programmes have since also branched out to communities outside of the city, with a greater emphasis on strengthening relationships and providing platforms,” said Jaffer. He added that entry to their events is generally free but the CCC does rely on donations to assist in funding their many programmes. Over the next months until November, there will be similar cultural programmes, fund-raisers, public events, an arts and culture summit and an exhibition. The line-up for the show included Sama award-winning songwriter Lionel Bastos, indigenous music band Khoi Konnexion and the multicultural Rosa Choir. The performances were vibrant, with each one providing a different cultural experience through the use of either indigenous musical instruments, the spoken word of poetry and even belly dancing, to name a few. Bonteheuwel Walking Ladies club member Latifah Sampson said they have been involved with CCC for the past five years and enjoy the cultural programmes. “It is amazing and so much fun seeing these performances, and so many of the young people who are involved. This is both a learning experience for young and old, while being entertained, and the performers share their cultures,” said Sampson.
