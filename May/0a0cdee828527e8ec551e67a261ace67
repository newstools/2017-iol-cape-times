This was the reaction of commissioner at the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) advocate Andre Gaum to the video, which a concerned Grassy Park resident forwarded to the media last week, after it had been widely circulated on Facebook. “What is depicted in this video is absolutely repulsive behaviour, which constitutes criminal conduct and need urgent investigation by not only SAPS, but also by the SAHRC,” Gaum said. In the video, the elderly man is seen looking under the raised bonnet of a car parked inside what appears to be a garage workshop. Three or four men are shown forcing the resisting elderly man towards the mechanical vice-grip into which they force his arm. They also blindfolded him when dragging him towards the vice-grip. A Grassy Park resident, who also received the video, said the workshop is not far from her home. Gaum said: “This is a very shocking incident that goes directly against our hard-fought constitution and Bill of Rights and this appears to be a clear violation of the victim’s right to human dignity. “It is therefore advisable that the victim lays a charge at SAPS, because this (action depicted on the video) constitutes assault.” The victim needed to either lay a complaint with the SAHRC, or the commission needed to institute an own-initiative investigation, he added. Department of Social Development MEC Albert Fritz strongly condemned the incident. He said the abuse of older persons should have no place in society, and that his department would investigate whether criminal charges were laid. Cape Mental Health's Carol Bosch said that, if they could get contact details for the elderly man, the institution would do an initial assessment to see whether he needed its services. Fritz appealed for information which could assist him in tracking down the elderly victim. The public could contact the DSD hotline on 0800 220 250, or alternatively the Police on 10111.  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
