The comedian and host of The Daily Show walked away with the award for Best Host. The result must have been particularly satisfying for Noah, who had to weather a campaign of negativity when he took over the reigns of this political satire show from the popular Jon Stewart in 2014. He honoured his mother in his acceptance speech. “There is one person I aspire to be like every single day, and that is my mom: a powerful, strong black woman who never listened when people told her she couldn’t be more,” he said. Noah also thanked his fans for their support on social media, and President Donald Trump for “the comedy”. “Thank you so much. And thank you to all the fans who’ve made this dream a reality. #ProudlySouthAfrican,” he tweeted. The Minister of Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, heartily congratulated Noah on his award. “In the period that marks Africa month, it is my great pleasure to congratulate one of Africa’s foremost media personalities, Trevor Noah on winning this prestigious award. We are thrilled and very proud of him for continuing to fly the South African flag high.” The 2017 MTV Movie and TV Awards were held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. It was the first time that television was represented in this popular awards show.
