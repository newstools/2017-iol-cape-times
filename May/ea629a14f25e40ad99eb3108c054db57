The DA filed urgent court papers in the North Gauteng High Court yesterday to block Molefe from performing any functions as Eskom chief executive and to ask the court to set aside the reappointment. On the same day, Molefe received a thunderous welcome from Eskom workers. In a video widely circulated on social networks, he is seen dancing with a large group of Eskom staff members at Megawatt Park. This was despite earlier threats by Cope members who had vowed to physically block him from entering the Eskom headquarters. Cope spokesperson Dennis Bloem alleged that Molefe had snuck into the premises escorted by VIP protection. There has been mounting opposition to Molefe’s appointment, with even the ANC condemning the decision as reckless. The party summoned Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown to its headquarters yesterday. An official said that Brown was at the ANC meeting, which was attended by President Jacob Zuma. Brown’s spokesperson, Colin Cruywagen, however, confirmed that the minister, who was cited as the first respondent in the DA court application, had been served with the court papers but refused to say whether she would challenge the application. Eskom board spokesperson Khulani Qoma said: “We have received the papers from the DA and we are going to defend our position in court.” The DA said it wanted the decision to reappoint Molefe overturned. Molefe quit the power utility after he was implicated in the public protector’s State of Capture report, which made observations of his relationship with the Gupta family. Corruption Watch and the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) said they were still deciding whether to join the court action. The Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans’ Association hit out at ANC leaders who had “condemned” Molefe’s return to the Eskom.
