Hashim Amla has broken yet another record – the fastest player to 7 000 runs in one-day international cricket! The 34-year-old Amla was looking in great touch once more as he was guiding the Proteas to victory against England in the third ODI at Lord’s on Monday. Amla surpassed the mark set by Indian superstar captain Virat Kohli for reaching 7 000 runs in 50-over cricket. The Proteas opener needed just 150 innings (in his 153rd match) to achieve the milestone compared to Kohli’s 161. This continues the South African right-hander’s remarkable sequence of records in one-day international cricket, as he is also the fastest to 2 000 runs, 3 000, 4 000, 5 000 and 6 000. Amla was eventually dismissed for 55 off 54 balls on Monday in an innings laced with some terrific cover drives.   One in particular that stood out was a punch off the back foot that raced to the boundary, with the Proteas well on their way to a consolation victory after dismissing England for 153 under cloudy skies in London.
