Stellenbosch University has suspended three students linked to Nazi-inspired posters put up on campus. A disciplinary process will now be followed. University rector and vice-chancellor Professor Wim de Villiers said: "When the matter was brought to our attention on Tuesday, both Management and the SRC immediately made it clear that we strongly condemn racism and attitudes of racial supremacy. The university's Equality Unit reported that the posters and advertised event promoting racial polarisation/superiority – combined with highly offensive references to Nazi propaganda and Neo-Nazism – were in breach of the university’s Policy on Unfair Discrimination and Harassment. It found that the behaviour and actions of the students in question had a demeaning and humiliating impact, and created an intimidating environment at the university. "Stellenbosch University is doing its utmost to be a diverse and inclusive institution. The venue booking was not approved by the University, and we did not have any information about the planned gathering before the posters were displayed – without permission. Campus Security was asked to remove the posters," De Villiers added.
