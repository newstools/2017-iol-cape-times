"The date of the hearing is the 17th of May next week," interim board chairwoman Khanyisile Kweyama said while briefing Parliament's portfolio committee on communications. Motsoeneng's appointment as COO was found by various courts to be unlawful. A ruling by the Western Cape High Court in December last year found that he was unfit to hold any office until such time a fresh disciplinary hearing cleared him of any wrongdoing, or if a court set aside the public protector's report which implicated him in lying about his academic qualifications, purging staff and giving himself generous salary increases. Kweyama confirmed to MPs that they rescinded a decision by the former board to take the public protector's report on review, meaning the disciplinary process would go ahead. African News Agency
