Once again, when the official opposition should be taking on Jacob Zuma and the ANC, and the enormous crisis that currently engulfs South Africa, it is too busy shooting itself in the foot. First it was Dianne Kohler Barnard, then Helen Zille, and now this. Not forgetting the partyâ€™s hypocrisy in letting off an MP (name withheld) with a mere slap on the wrist for his blatant sexual assault on a colleague. Where are the liberal values? Where is the fairness and even-handedness? Welcome to the new, uber-Stalinist DA. Who the hell is in charge there these days? Big Brother? Mark Lowe Durban
