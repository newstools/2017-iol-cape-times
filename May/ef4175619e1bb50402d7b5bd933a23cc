Khoza was a guest speaker at the Making Africa Work book launch on Thursday night in Durban when she impressed IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and former president of Nigeria Olusegun Obasanjo with her views against what Zuma and his followers had claimed to be struggling for. She alleged there was an incorrect understanding of radical economic transformation within her party, which she said was chasing away investors. “We have the constitution which is promising us prosperity, and we are abusing it trying to say this one is a white monopoly capitalist and chasing away investment,” she said. Khoza said the country faced challenges of leadership failing to make right decisions. She said young people want the government to fix the education system, the health system, and create opportunities for them to prosper. She said young people were in favour of the capitalist system because they want to prosper. Buthelezi said he was “very proud” with Khoza’s stand on the issue of the economy. Obasanjo also supported the existence of a free economic system, which he said should work in partnership with the government.
