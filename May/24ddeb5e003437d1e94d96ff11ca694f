Orlando Pirates soccer player Patrick Phungwayo appeared at the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court on Tuesday on a charge of attempted murder, assault and possession of an unlicensed firearm. Phungwayo, 29, and his brother, Phelelani Aubrey Phungwayo, were at a party in Spruitview, east of Johannesburg, at the the weekend when they were involved in an altercation with another man. The man was allegedly assaulted and then shot at. The bullet hit his ring finger. The Pirates left-back and his brother were arrested on Monday, but police failed to find the firearm that was allegedly used in the incident. On Tuesday, magistrate Van Der Hoevel granted the brothers bail of R2 000 each. The matter was postponed to June 23 for further investigation. In March, it was reported that Patrick was allegedly embroiled in a bitter war with an Alexandra mechanic over an unpaid R2 941 bill. Petrus Nemamila, 51, dragged the star to the Small Claims Court over the money, which he says has been due since February when he finished repairing the Golf 3 which he says belongs to Phungwayo. At the end of last year, Patrick allegedly tried to run from the law for four weeks while facing assault charges for kicking around his employees, Sunday World reported. This was said to have taken place after they furnished him with a letter from the Department of Labour after he allegedly failed to pay their wages.
