Police spokesperson Andre Traut said they are investigating a double murder following the shooting of Theodore Wright, 32, and his 22-year-old friend whose name was not released by police. Traut said the motive for the shooting was yet to be determined and no-one had been arrested. Wright’s father Oom Wright said he heard the door of his son being kicked, six shots fired and when he went to look what was happening he saw his son and the friend lying in a pool of blood next to each other on the floor next to the bed. “It is clear they (the gunmen) first opened the window to see where were they (the deceased) weresleeping, and when the gunmen saw they were sleeping in the bedroom they kicked (in) the door, forcing their entry,” said the grieving father. “They must have heard the gunmen and stood up from bed but it seems the gunmen shot them before they could do anything,” said Wright. He said his son, who was a father of two, was celebrating his birthday at the weekend. “His happiness was short lived. It is never something to smile about to lose your only son,” said Wright. When the Cape Times arrived at the wendy house, the floor was covered in blood. Wright said he was in pain. He said his son was not part of a gang. “We don’t believe it is gang-related because we know he was not involved in gangs. We don’t know what could have resulted in the shooting,” said Wright. He appealed to young people not to use weapons or guns when they have differences but to talk. “We are very sad because he was healthy and just celebrated his birthday. Why would anyone shoot someone at his home, it shows disrespect,” he said. Police arrived on the scene soon after the shots were fired, and Wright commended them saying this showed that they were serious about tackling crime and putting murderers behind bars.  sandiso.phaliso@inl.co.za  @PhalisoSandiso
