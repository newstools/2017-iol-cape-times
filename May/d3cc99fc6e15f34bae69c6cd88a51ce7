Fourteen-month-old Lindokuhle Kota was buried yesterday while her father Ntuthuzelo Mayekiso, 25, made his second appearance in the Khayelitsha Magistrate's Court on a murder charge. Prosecutor Andrew Edem told magistrate Wernon Jantjies that he would oppose bail for Mayekiso because he has 20 previous convictions and two warrants of arrest on his name. “Leave bail, I have cases on my name,” said Mayekiso. Edem told Jantjies the charge of murder against Manyekisowas a Schedule Six offence, meaning the onus was on the accused during the bail application to prove to the court that it is in the best interest of the accused, community and justice that he be granted bail. Mayekiso was all set to apply for bail but then abandoned the idea. Earlier it also emerged that Mayekiso has been arrested 44 times on charges ranging from theft to assault and escaping from custody. He was acquitted on the escaping from custody charge; the rest are pending at various courts. Mayekiso was convicted of murder in 2005 at the age of 13 and served his sentence at a reformatory school, as he was a minor at the time. He has a rape conviction. Details of  the murder and rape convictions were not clear. Nor is when they were committed or how long he served for these convictions. The Social Justice Coalition’s head of safety and justice, Chumile Sali, said the decision by Mayekiso to abandon his bail application was the best choice because residents could have taken the law into their own hands if he had been granted bail.
