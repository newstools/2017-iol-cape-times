Once again outrage is expressed and once again we stand shocked and amazed that such a dastardly deed could be committed in our
community. If media reports are correct, then the circumstances of the taking and murder of Courtney Peters, confirms a horrible pattern. Once again, as in the case of Sasha-Leigh of Ottery so many years ago, and that of Rene Roman of Lavender Hill, the suspect is the friendly neighbour next door, or the one living on the same property as the deceased child. This is evil. This must stop. This has gone on for too long and, let's be clear about one thing, it is enough. How do we deal with this as a community and a nation of good people? We need the criminal justice system to be on the side of children who are always vulnerable. Perpetrators know they will not get the death penalty and appear to be willing to take their chances that a clever lawyer will be able to get them acquitted. Once again, I am faced with the issue of the death penalty. I was never sure that the death penalty could be a deterrent, but now I am prepared to reconsider my opinion and say ENOUGH is ENOUGH. Hang these evil devils. It looks to me that, if a referendum is called on the death penalty, the majority of South Africans will vote YES. In the meantime, our bail laws can be changed to deny bail automatically in cases where there is good prima facie evidence of “taking” of children; abduction and murder of children; or other violence against children. Once again South Africa is robbed of a future genius, perhaps even a president or moral compass of our nation. It is not right that parents should bury their children in such circumstances. A young life is snuffed out and a community is once again traumatised. Let's put a stop to this. Our lawmakers need to catch a wake-up call here. Do something about it. Philip Bam Grassy Park
