The two suspects arrested in connection to the murder of four-year-old Iyapha Yamile have been remanded in custody until their formal bail application. Thabo Titus and Thabiso Mtshanguta appeared in Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Their case was postponed to case May 29. The State yesterday indicated that it would be opposed to bail being granted to the accused. The two were among four people arrested in connection with the murder of Iyapha. She went missing while playing with friends in Town Two, Khayelitsha on April 30. At the time of her disappearance, she had been visiting her aunt. Her body was found a stuffed in a plastic bag a stone’s throw from her aunt’s house. Her family had suspected Iyapha may had been raped as her lower body had blood. About two hundred residents along with civil rights organisations protested outside the court, calling for bail to be denied against the accused.
