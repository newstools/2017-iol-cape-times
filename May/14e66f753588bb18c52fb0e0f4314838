Rubain, from Hanover Park, says the concert will be in aid of a shooting victim, who has since been bedridden. “Randall Julies was shot through the neck last year during an armed robbery along Strandfontein Road. “He has been bedridden (since the shooting).” Julies is believed to have been the breadwinner of his family. Rubain says he decided to do the concert for Julies, who is also from Hanover Park, due to the success of his recent DVD recording. “Julies is a guy from my home town although he doesn’t live there anymore. I just knew I had to do something for him and his family.” All proceeds from the concert will go to the Julies family to assist with medical costs. The concert will take place on May 27 at the AFM Church in Hanover Park. The concert starts at 6:30pm and tickets cost R50.
