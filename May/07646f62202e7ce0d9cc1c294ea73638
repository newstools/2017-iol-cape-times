Peter le Roux is set to enter a plea in the circuit court in Swellendam for the murder of his mother Francina van der Merwe. On Wednesday, legal teams including the judge and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) will be visiting the murder scene in Skoolkop, Vermaaklikheid near Riversdal to carry out an inspection in loco where legal teams and authorities will visit and examine the scene. On Monday, Eric Ntabazalila of the NPA indicated Le Roux would be entering a plea and is expected to plead guilty to murdering his mother on the evening of 28 July last year. Le Roux, who shared the house with his mother, allegedly attempted, but failed, to poison her with ant poison. The son and mother are believed to have had an “unstable and broken relationship”. While Francina was asleep, he allegedly attacked her with a spade and crowbar. He then apparently dragged her lifeless body from the back of a car until he reached the bushes. There he is believed to have dumped the body. He also allegedly attempted to burn his mother’s bloodied clothing and the murder weapons, but did not succeed. A day later, Francina’s bloodied body was discovered in a bush not far from her home. Le Roux was allegedly the one who took police to the crime scene, pointing out the body, the spade and crowbar. She died as a result of severe head trauma and suffered blood loss caused by a blow from a sharp object. Daily Voice
