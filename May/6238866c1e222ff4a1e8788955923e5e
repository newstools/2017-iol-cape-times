Manchester - The suspected suicide
bomber who killed 22 people at a concert in Manchester, northern
England, on Monday has been identified as 22-year-old Salman
Abedi, British police said.  Abedi was born in Manchester in 1994 to parents of Libyan
birth, US security officials said, citing British intelligence
officials. His parents emigrated from Libya to London before moving to
the Fallowfield area of south Manchester, where they have lived
for at least 10 years, the officials said.  Police raided a house in Elsmore Road in Fallowfield earlier
on Tuesday.  A 23-year-old man arrested by police in a separate move in
south Manchester in connection with the attack on Tuesday was
believed to be Abedi's brother, news reports said.  Abedi had a sister named Jomana Abedi, the US security
officials said. Reuters
