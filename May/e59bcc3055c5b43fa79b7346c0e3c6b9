State Security Minister David Mahlobo has reignited the debate on party funding after he accused opposition parties of collaborating with foreign governments in a bid to topple the state. This came after Mahlobo said yesterday that a number of foreign governments were using “underhanded tactics” to remove the democratically elected government of South Africa. Part of their plan was to use NGOs and opposition parties. He said this had also reopened the debate on party funding. The now defunct Institute for Democracy in South Africa (Idasa) lost on two occasions in court trying to get parties in Parliament to disclose their funders. Idasa argued the country needed to know who was funding parties that people were voting for and that were representing them in Parliament. Opposition parties have warned in Parliament that opening up their books would expose their funders, who could be intimidated by the state. In his budget vote speech in Parliament, Mahlobo said there were many ways foreign governments were pursuing a regime-change agenda. “Their general strategy (was to) use a range of role-players to promote their agenda, and these include certain sections of mainstream media; certain non-governmental organisations and community-based organisations; foreign and multinational companies; funding of opposition activities, infiltration and recruitment in key government departments; religious bodies; prominent influential persons; and intelligence networks and covert action on our soil,” said Mahlobo. He said there were countries that wanted to strong-arm South Africa, but he did not name them or the opposition parties involved.
