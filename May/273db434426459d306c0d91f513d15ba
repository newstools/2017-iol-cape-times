The play will now be performed in the Fugard Studio Theatre until May 20. Hemelruim is the translation of Broadway and West End runaway hit Constellations, by Nick Payne, which won the 2012 Evening
Standard Award for best new production. The play is a beautiful story of two souls who keep drifting in and out of each othersâ€™ lives, in an honest, raw and moving journey through the stars, filled with love, science and honey. It features a stellar South African team of cast members: Paul du Toit, Tinarie van Wyk Loots and director Nico Scheepers. Van Wyk Loots won best actress awards at Aardklop and the Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees,
as well as a 2016 Fiesta award for Hemelruim. The play is performed in
Afrikaans, with English
subtitles. Performances will be from Wednesday to Friday at 8pm and on Saturday at 4pm and 8pm. The Fugard Theatre is on the corner of Harrington and Caledon streets, Cape Town. *  Tickets cost from R130 to R165 and can be booked through Computicket at 0861 915 8000, online at www.computicket.com or at any Shoprite Checkers outlet.
