Protesters have erected 10 makeshift shacks and have been squatting there for a week to express their dissatisfaction over “20 years of unfulfilled promises” by the municipality to build low cost houses in the town. Community leader Burton Beukes said Swellendam mayor Nicholas Myburgh had met with the community three weeks ago, but had failed to address their issues. “We received the eviction notice on Wednesday but refused to sign it as we are exercising our right to peaceful protest. This municipality that boasts of clean audits, received a R10 million grant for housing in 2003 for Suurbraak but our people are still living in harsh conditions,” said Beukes. He said their protest, for which permission was denied last week, was approved for this Sunday and a united community would finally voice their many grievances. Suurbraak Youth Movement chairperson Donovan Julius said their shacks represented the conditions many residents still lived in and these structures were even better than some of the homes. He said their people still lived in mud huts and the youth would continue to stand with their elders. Municipal Manager Cecil Africa said the eviction notice was issued as per the law and the protest was approved but neither he nor Myburgh would be there. Myburgh said because it was on a Sunday and on Mother’s Day, he could not attend and he has plans. He said he could not answer for the previous administration and the protesters must take their complaints to the Auditor-General, who has consecutively given Swellendam municipality clean audits.
