Hansraj was called as a State witness in the criminal trial involving former Western Cape police commissioner Arno Lamoer and his co-accused, senior police officers Darius van der Ross, Kolindren Govender and his wife Sharon, along with businessman Mohamed Dawjee. They face over 100 charges of fraud and corruption. “They wanted to frame me,” Hansraj said. However, she stated that she could not reveal her sources. Hansraj testified that Dawjee, who owns businesses in Goodwood and Parow, was a regular complainant at Goodwood police station. “He (also) wanted to give the impression that he was well-connected," she said. Hansraj recalled an incident where Dawjee was “abusive, calling (officers) various names”. She said he made a point of mentioning that he was affiliated with Pagad (People Against Gangsterism and Drugs). “I don’t think it was appropriate. He also said that General Lamoer was aware of his association,” Hansraj added. She said she felt threatened by Dawjee, and laid a charge of intimidation, harassment and defamation of character. But Hansraj said nothing came of it. “There were stoppers. I could not get anywhere with the people in front of me.” She asked her cluster commander, Van der Ross, to facilitate a meeting with Lamoer to discuss her concerns, but was told by the former to transfer to another station “for my sanity”. Lamoer, said his lawyer Grant Smith, and Dawjee had a long-standing friendship. “Accused four (Lamoer) does not deny dinner and communication, but he does deny any corrupt relations," Smith said. “He denies victimising or influencing any police official or person in general." But Hansraj replied: “I felt victimised.”
