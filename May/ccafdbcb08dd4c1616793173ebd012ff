Parliament – The Presidency budget debate descended into chaos as MPs hurled insults at each other, with some even advising each other to seek psychological help. MPs from the ruling African National Congress (ANC) were on their feet as Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane led the anti-Zuma charge during his speech – including a reference to “President Gupta” and telling MPs a vote for the presidency was a vote for the controversial family at the centre of state capture allegations. “We cannot come and pretend that the presidency is not the headquarters of a Gupta empire, with President Zuma acting as a front for them,” said Maimane. “This is a budget for president Gupta. Keep that in mind when you cast your vote.” ANC MPs demanded an immediate withdrawal from Maimane, with Speaker Baleka Mbete insisting Maimane take back his words or risk not being able to finish his speech. As both sides shouted insults at each other, Maimane reluctantly withdrew the reference to “President Gupta”, but added: “If the shoe fits, you should wear it.” DA chief whip John Steenhuisen and Mbete then took aim at each other. Mbete advised Steenhuisen to “go for anger management”, with Steenhuisen retorting the Speaker needed “some serious sessions of psychiatry”. Maimane earlier paid tribute to the ANC’s longest serving president, Oliver Tambo, chiding ANC MPS for invoking his name during budget debates. “Honourable members, every single time you mention OR Tambo, you remind us how far the ANC has fallen. It pains me to say that the ANC of Oliver Tambo does not exist anymore… “This president, this man, happened. He killed the ANC,” the opposition leader said as he pointed at Zuma. Maimane, who indicated his caucus would vote against the presidency’s budget, said those who approved the budget vote were supporting a “mafia shadow state”. African News Agency
