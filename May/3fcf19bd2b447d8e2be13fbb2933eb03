The spectacular facility was created by the departments of Arts and Culture and of Science and Technology, the National Research Foundation, the National Lotteries Commission, and faculties of the University of Cape Town, University of the Western Cape (UWC) and Cape Peninsula University of Technology. At the launch yesterday, images of planets and stars in all their glory were exposed to the audience with the use of the world's most advanced digital visualisation technology. Iziko Museums SA chief executive officer Rooksana Omar said the technology used for the planetarium made it the most advanced facility on the continent. “The new dome will be an unparalleled interactive learning experience for visitors and a significant tool for scientific research. "The technology at the disposal of scientists will assist to develop the skills and infrastructure required for projects such as the Square Kilometre Array, Southern African Large Telescope and MeerKAT radio telescope,” said Omar. Over R220million was being invested to renovate the existing four-storey research space into a seven-storey facility. UWC department of physics and astrology Associate Professor Michelle Cluver said the facility held a unique data research cluster. “This enables us to work with research data from scientists from various fields and disciplines, and then place their work onto the dome. "We will incorporate that as far as possible into locally produced content, focusing on the cutting-edge science produced in South Africa that people are not aware of,” she said. Tickets for the official reopening on Saturday can only be purchased at the door, and visitors are encouraged to arrive early, as each show is limited to 140 seated.
