Lincoln is suing for damages related to malicious and unlawful prosecution of 47 charges for which he was acquitted. State witness Pieter Senekal of the SAPS Intervention Management Unit said the Pitu took over many investigations that were not in their prescribed mandate. Senekal testified that 34 dockets of attempted murder and assault were taken over by Pitu that should have been investigated by the police. “This brings into question the objectivity of the presidential task unit. They also interfered with the Narcotics Unit, who at the time did not need a warrant to conduct searches. This left room for the Narcotics Unit to be wrongly used to conduct searches,” Senekal testified. He said all the interference was in an “artificial” attempt to prolong the lifespan of the unit. “This is why they interfered with the investigations of other units. There was no concrete evidence that Pitu achieved success while they were in existence.” Senekal was tasked by the national commissioner to evaluate a request by Pitu for resources. While he was busy conducting his investigation, he says: “Other information was brought under my attention that I could not ignore.” On this Lincoln's lawyer, Johan Nortje, said: “Your mandate was not to investigate director Lincoln, your mandate was not a criminal investigation, but rather evaluation services.” Nortje continued his cross-examination by introducing evidence, a letter from Mandela that stated what Pitu's mandate was: “To investigate all illegal activity by Vito Roberto Palazzolo and all activities relating to Palazzolo.” This insinuated that Lincoln's unit getting involved with the cases of other units was directly linked to his mandate: “That Lincoln’s mandate was not clearly defined, giving Lincoln wide powers.” On this Senekal agreed. Nortje also questioned whether Senekal informed Lincoln that he was under investigation, to which Senekal responded that he could not recall. The trial continues today.
