Chairman of the portfolio committee on police Francois Beukman yesterday said he did not rule out MPs raising the issue with Mbalula 
during tomorrow's proceedings. But officially the fight between the two is set to be discussed on June 6 at a portfolio committee meeting set to be attended by Mbalula. Beukman said tomorrow's debate will look at the budget of the police and the allocation of resources. McBride and Phahlane were involved in a no-holds barred fight in Parliament two weeks ago. McBride had complained about Phahlane’s interference in investigations against him. But the police chief denied the Ipid claims of interference and said he did not appoint himself to the position and was not there by force. Phahlane also denied that he had set up a unit from the North West to harass Ipid officials investigating him for corruption. Beukman said they have asked both Ipid and SAPS to submit further documents to the committee. Phahlane had also accused Ipid of working with private investigator Paul O’Sullivan. The acting police commissioner said Ipid had also gone to raid his house with O’Sullivan and questioned his minor daughter. But McBride has denied they have done anything wrong, and accused Phahlane of trying to stifle the investigation. He said Ipid had followed the law in the investigations they had conducted against Phahlane but he had set up a unit against them. Beukman had called on both Ipid and SAPS to respect each other. He said the laws governing the two institutions were important in ensuring that each institution functioned properly and within the required mandate.
