The origin of the fire has not been determined, which caused damage to a school already in desperate need of restoration. The fire occurred on Saturday afternoon and left three classrooms gutted as 20 firefighters battled to contain the blaze. Manenberg Steering Committee secretary Nuraan Barnes-Pieters said they were in communication with the educators and parents, who were waiting for the department’s plans to address the situation. “The school has already been earmarked for restoration under the province and department’s urban upgrade plans, as there were classrooms that were without electricity. We are waiting for the department to provide us with solutions in the wake of the fire, so the children can return to their studies with minimal disturbance,” said Barnes-Pieters. She said the community was relieved that no one was hurt during the fire. There have been no reports as to what could have caused the blaze. City Fire and Rescue spokesperson Liezl Moodie said six firefighter vehicles and 20 firefighters attended to the fire on Saturday. “No injuries or fatalities were reported and the cause is undetermined at this stage. An investigator was dispatched to the scene yesterday (Saturday) and we await his findings tomorrow (today),” said Moodie. She said there could be no speculation as to the origin of the fire until the report has been submitted by the investigator. Basic education spokesperson Jessica Shelver said the department was waiting for the City’s report to determine the full extent of the damage. “The district director has informed the department that the school has enough classrooms to function normally and that the pupils education will not be negatively impacted. Our Safe Schools have also deployed emergency security to the school,” said Shelver.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
