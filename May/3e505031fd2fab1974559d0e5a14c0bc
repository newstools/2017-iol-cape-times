Crews, duos and solo dancers gave their all in front of judges, family members and the crowd at the university’s auditorium. More than 300 dancers from the Cape Town Metro, Eden, Boland, Overberg and West Coast  competed against each other. Provincial secretary for the South African Fitness Sport Aerobic Federation (SASAFF) Estelle Swart said participants ranged from the age of 7 to 57 in various categories. “There are different categories including aerobics, dance crews, duos and solo who have to earn points to represent the province at the National Championships in June. However, we have also allowed for an open category which are our younger and first-timers, being allowed to participate and get a feel of what the competition is like,” said Swart. She said the younger participants would receive certificates and some medals as the senior groups and dancers compete to represent the country . Coach and choreographer Marzanne le Roux said she had dancers participating in 18 categories throughout the competition. She said teams hoping to represent the province at the national level would have to excel at skill, intricacy and difficulty. Choreographer Everton van der Westhuizen said there were entities stating they represented national boards but were not officially affiliated with the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc). He said because of this there was no team representing South Africa at international level this year. The national championship will be held at the end of June at the Bellville Velodrome and for information visit www.sasaff.co.za or call 021 949 6023.
