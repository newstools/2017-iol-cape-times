Cape Town – The security guard, critically wounded in a 12-hour hostage drama inside the Shoprite store at Nyanga Junction, near Manenberg, has died. "He passed away this morning. His health deteriorated while in hospital," said Corne Vermeulen spokesperson for Tsu Protection Services, which is responsible for security at all Shoprite stores. The 28-year-old guard, whose name has not been released, hailed from Mitchells Plain and had been with the company less than a year, said Vermeulen. "We would like to offer our condolences to his family. Things are quite sad at the office at the moment, it's not a good time for us now," he said. Ten people were rescued after the police’s special task force pounced, arresting one of a group of armed robbers who held up Shoprite staff on Monday. “SAPS experts comprising hostage negotiators, Task Force members, National Intervention Unit and detectives descended on the premises following an attempted armed robbery. “Several shots were heard inside the mall. Reports indicate a shoot-out between security personnel and suspects had occurred early in the morning,” police spokesperson Novela Potelwa said after the drama ended on Monday night. A suspect wounded during the drama is in hospital under police guard. At about 6am on Monday a group of armed men took Shoprite staff hostage, the retailer said in a statement. “Five supermarket employees, three contracted security personnel and two employees from the contracted cleaning company were held hostage by the armed men inside the store for almost 12 hours.” Trauma counselling was arranged for workers affected, Shoprite's statement said. Concerned residents from Manenberg and Gugulethu watched as the police hostage negotiators engaged the armed robbers. Metrorail train service was restricted to Heideveld and Philippi stations and service was still affected on Tuesday morning. Cape Argus
