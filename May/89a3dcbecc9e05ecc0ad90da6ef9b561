Ramaphosa told Cosatu central committee delegates on Tuesday that the ANC belonged to them as well and they were correct when speaking out about their concerns. "Nobody should be told to shut up. Cosatu should be concerned about what happens in the ANC, what happens in the ANC affects you," said Ramaphosa to loud applause from delegates. "There is an elephant in the room, and that is State Capture and it's eating away at the ANC," he said. Ramaphosa's utterances can be attributed to Cosatu being criticised for speaking out on its support of Ramaphosa to be elected as ANC president at the party's elective conference in December.

A number of ANC members questioned why the federation was concerned about the goings on at the ANC instead of sticking to its issues. Ramaphosa said as equal partners of the ANC led alliance with the SACP, they should have been consulted when President Jacob Zuma decided to reshuffle his abinet. He also applauded the ANC NEC for agreeing that an investigation had to be conducted into State Capture and said the truth had come out. He said the issues facing the ANC had to do with patronage and capturing of the state. "The issues facing the alliance are about who should hold which position, this needs to change," said Ramaphosa. @ZintleMahlati Politics and Development Hub
