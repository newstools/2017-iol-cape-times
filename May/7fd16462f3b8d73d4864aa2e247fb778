Hundreds of community members and supporters from across Cape Town have gathered at the family's Pluto Street home ahead of the funeral. A large contingent of bikers have also joined mourners coming to pay their last respects to the little girl. Earlier this week, Mortimer Saunders, a close family friend who rented a home in the Pieters home, was arrested for the child's rape and murder.
