Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown has instructed the board of South Africa’s power utility Eskom to rescind a decision to reappoint Brian Molefe as chief executive officer. Brown and her colleagues from the inter-ministerial committee tasked to look at the matter made the announcement in Parliament at lunchtime on Wednesday. Brown further intimated that she would fire the Eskom board over the bungle that brought Molefe back to the helm of Eskom six months after he left. She said she would have “an opportunity to rotate the board” after its annual general meeting next month, and would not act immediately so as not to upset the markets. “I would like to not send more scurrying into the markets.” – African News Agency (ANA)
