Last week a meeting between Swellendam mayor Nicholas Myburgh, municipal directors from various departments and residents broke down following arguments and accusations. Community leader Burton Beukes said the pine forest was planted by the community more than 20 years ago and the municipality failed to provide clear answers. “The wood is commercially sought after and can only be harvested 20 to 50 years after planting, depending on how the trees are maintained. Our community planted these trees and consent was given for them to be harvested after promises that the proceeds from their sale would be ploughed back into the community,” said Beukes. He said after 10 years the community was demanding answers and wanted  the funding to be geared towards its youth or community-based projects. Suurbraak Youth Movement chairperson Donovan Julies said they attended the meeting and were dismissed by the mayor and his directors. “Mayor Myburgh said the meeting was called by himself, with the intention of answering the many questions the community posed to his administration. “The harvesting occurred in 2007 and was part of a larger harvest in the area by the previous administration in the Swellendam area. Suurbraak’s harvest was a small portion and the amount they have heard quoted is incorrect as it was between R300-R400 000 and Swellendam’s approximately R6 million,” said Mybrugh. He said while the municipality was  investing in the region of R8m a year into Suurbraak, the amount received from the community by way of taxes and rates only came to R6m yearly. “We have engaged the community but the meetingwas disrupted by a few unwilling to listen to reason. The funds were placed in the municipality’s accounts which are used in various service-related means for the entire municipality,” said Myburgh.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
