 Group executive editor for the Western Cape Gasant Abarder,introduced staffers and guests to the panel at the Table Bay Hotel at the V&A Waterfront. Abarder said the ombudsman's office would use "tough love" to ensure Independent Media's editors and journalists are kept on their toes. This sentiment was echoed by Group Ombudsman Jovial Rantao. "It doesn't matter if you're a celebrated editor or not, tough love is coming your way," he said.     The Adjudication Panel includes chairperson Rantao, Moleboheng Mosia, Brijilal Ramguthee, Michael Buthelezi, Prof William Gumede, Advocate Nthabiseng Mokoena, Ryland Fisher, Paul Esselaar, Dennis Pather, Rich Mkhondo, Lloyd Mogotsi, Mansoor Jaffer and Ronald Bernickow. Independent Media Executive Chairman Iqbal Surv√© thanked Rantao for doing an "excellent job" so far, and wished the panel well for the future.
