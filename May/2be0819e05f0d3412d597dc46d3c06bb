In his plea explanation, triple murder accused Henri van Breda said he wanted to call emergency services, but did not know the number, so called his then girlfriend Bianca van der Westhuizen, but she didn’t answer. He then found an emergency number, but twice failed to get through. He finally got through from the landline and tried to remain calm. He said he spoke calmly in case the operator did not understand his Australian accent. Van Breda is standing trial in the Western Cape High Court for the murder of his mother Teresa, 55, father Martin 54, and brother Rudi, 22, who were attacked and killed with an axe. Van Der Westhuizen said she assumed Van Breda called her because he had no one else to contact. Earlier this week, the first paramedic to arrive at the house, the recently retired Christiaan Koegelenberg, told the court the crime scene was the worst he had seen in his 39-year career.
