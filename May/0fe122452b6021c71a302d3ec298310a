That was the view of non-profit organisation Cape Town Embrace, whose project manager, Julie Mentor,  spoke of how they used its Mothers Connect project to support new mothers and their babies at 22 maternity hospitals around the country yesterday. The visits provided an opportunity for the Cape Town Embrace, Mothers Connect project and their volunteers to honour the vital role mothers play in society. About 30 mothers visited 70 new moms at Karl Bremer Hospital’s maternity facility in Bellville: “Mother’s Day is one of the ways we support families with young babies, specifically within the first 
1 000 days of a new baby's life,” Mentor said. She said they gave out baby-bags, nappies, toiletries and care items. A photographer was also on hand to take portraits of the moms and their babies to print as gifts for them. “The purpose of the visit was to make sure every 
(new) mom feels special and appreciated on Mother’s 
Day. "The mothers we visited were touched and happy to be celebrated and spoilt." The NPO also wanted to ensure that every woman who gives birth on Mother’s Day is told that she is wonderful and strong and that her baby is a gift to our world.
