 A few months. That was all it took for Cape Town City to breathe life back into the Mother City. Cape Town has a rich history when it comes to football, but over the past few years, the level of (winning) football dropped, and English Premier League clubs like Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City were all anyone ever spoke or argued about. Enter John Comitis, Eric Tinkler and a string of brilliant footballers, and just like that, Capetonians in their thousands are making the trek to Cape Town Stadium, dressed top to bottom in their blue and gold. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying Cape Town never watched PSL football, or that they never supported the other Cape Town teams like Ajax. But I have never felt this level of excitement for local soccer in Cape Town. Excitement that had nothing to do with Chiefs, Pirates or Sundowns. It is a story about a group of people labelled “misfits” by the press, who rallied against the odds through sheer hard work and belief to become Cup champions, league title contenders, and capture the hearts and minds of people all over South Africa.
