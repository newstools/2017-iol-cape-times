Zuma said the SACP had failed to promote socialism, which was much needed in South Africa, while Cosatu had paid little attention to the challenges facing workers. He was addressing hundreds of church leaders, their followers and ANC supporters in Durban, during a prayer service to “protect him from his adversaries”. Zuma lashed out at certain ANC leaders for holding meetings in “dark corners” to discuss party matters, instead of doing so within legitimate party structures. He also said he was being harassed, despite the fact that he would not again run for president of the ANC and the country. The prayer gathering,  at People’s Park in Durban, came in the wake of a number of calls for Zuma to step down before the end of his term - in 2019. Among those calling for his head are senior ANC leaders and veterans. In reference to the SACP, Zuma said “some people should talk about socialism instead of the ANC”. “They have time to waste discussing the ANC on Saturday and Sunday. They don't talk about themselves while they have serious problems of their own. “We were told that we are going to adopt socialism. When are we going to start fighting for it?” he asked. He said Cosatu should focus on workers’ issues. He said, since the world was approaching the fourth industrial revolution, “computers are taking over jobs from workers”. “We don't hear them discussing the future of the workers, but they are busy discussing the ANC. “Ever since the ANC was started you have never heard it - even for a single day - discussing one of the alliance partners,” he said.
