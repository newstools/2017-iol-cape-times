Along with the shades, and a Lofob Blind Buddy sticker, participants will also be required to donate R10. Lofob spokesperson Heidi Volkwijn said the Blind Buddy Day was started as a fundraising initiative for Lofob. “Like any other NGO, the organisation depends on donations either from government, corporates or individuals to ensure that it fulfils its commitment to society,” said Volkwijn. “The proceeds of this event will go to the early childhood development programme currently being run at the centre, catering for infants up to six years old,” Volkwijn explains. The Lofob ECD programme is one of five of its kind in the country and the only one of its kind in the Western Cape. Up to 55 children and their parents or caregivers benefit from the services each year.   Programmes are guided by professional staff including occupational therapist, a social worker, a preschool teacher, Braille facilitator, orientation and mobility practitioner and a music facilitator.
