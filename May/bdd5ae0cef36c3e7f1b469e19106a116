The Western Cape radio station confirmed on Friday morning major line-up changes that will take place at the station, including Darren "Whackhead" Simpson replacing O'Connor as breakfast show host. From July O'Connor, who has won awards for his show, will be moved into the weekday work slot, from 10am to 1pm. O'Connor didn't have too much to say, but sent out a suspicious tweet.     “Ryan has a fantastic connection with listeners,” said Trish Taylor, CEO Primedia Broadcasting Western Cape said in a statement on Friday. "We believe that he’s going to turn this show into ‘can’t-miss- it’ radio and are thrilled to have such a dynamic broadcaster steering us through this new chapter as we shake up daytime radio.” The station added: "Darren is one of South Africa’s most prominent commercial broadcasters, having hosted 947’s Breakfast Xpress for 7 years, and featuring on the breakfast show for 7 years before that. "He’s won numerous awards including multiple nods for ‘Best local radio personality’ in the Best of Joburg Awards. Darren achieved national fame through his notorious “Whackhead” pranks, which hit record sales year after year and have totalled over half a million units sold. The pranks also featured on KFM breakfast so there is an existing connection between Darren and the Western Cape audience," the station said.  IOL
