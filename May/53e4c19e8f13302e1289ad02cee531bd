 De Zalze Estate security manager Marcia Rossouw wrapped up her testimony in Henri van Breda's triple-murder trial, saying the butchered family did not have an alarm in their house. Rossouw was on the stand for two days and advocate Pieter Botha introduced CCTV footage highlighting certain instances of vehicles entering the premises without being properly logged.

Rossouw testified she was unaware of this and because registration at the entrance was done manually, human error was possible. She said while the instances should have been logged, that particular case could have been someone with an access tag. They would not be required to sign the visitors' log.
