A new shuttle business has launched in the Western Cape to provide local and international tourists affordable transportation to key tourist destinations. Cape Comoot will initially run from Greenmarket Square to Cape Point and Franschhoek and cost R99 for a one-way trip. It’s the brainchild of Martin Bo Nielsen and Yolandie le Grange, the founders of Cape Town Free Walking Tours. They have an eye for gaps in the market and passion for making a difference to communities around them. Nielson says: “Tourists come to South Africa and expect public transport to tourist sites outside of the city centres. Independent travellers want to go straight to their destination, without the inconvenience of stops along the way or taking a tour bus. “We have been asked how we can provide a shuttle service at R99 one way when the industry is charging R800 to R1500 a person,” says Le Grange. “This is part of our business model. We are passionate about guests to the city being able to take transport at the price of public transport in any other global destination.” Cape Comoot shuttles have air-conditioning, free wi-fi, and mobile phone charging stations.
