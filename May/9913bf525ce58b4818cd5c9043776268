Bangkok - A woman in northern Thailand chopped off her
unfaithful husband's penis and then drank pesticide to her death,
local police told dpa on Tuesday. Kawinnart Saezong, 33, was declared dead on Monday at a hospital in
Phayao province, said Narin Cherdyoo, Phayao police officer. Kawinnart's suicide happened soon after she chopped off her
38-year-old husband's penis while he was asleep early Saturday, after
she learned of his multiple infidelities, Narin said. Her husband, Niran Saewang, survived the attack, Narin said. He was
transferred from Phayao to Lampang hospital, which is a
three-hour drive, and had his penis reattached, a hospital staff
confirmed to dpa. Hospital staff in Phayao managed to retrieve Niran's penis and froze
it with ice during the hospital transfer, according to Lampang
hospital. This is not the first time Lampang hospital has had to deal with such
a case, the hospital said, adding that all of the penis reattachment
surgeries there had been successful. Niran is recuperating at the hospital following Monday's successful
surgery, the hospital said. Doctors said he could urinate but will no
longer be able to perform sexually again. dpa
