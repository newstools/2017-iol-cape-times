The executive mayor of Theewaterskloof Municipality, Christelle Vosloo, said she is investigating metro officers who were caught on camera pelting apples at alleged thieves. In a media statement, she said: "I noted the video footage showing people, dressed in the uniforms of law enforcers, throwing apples at the victims. I regard the conduct of the attackers as inhumane and a gross violation of the safety and dignity of their victims."     She added that she will meet with the victims and ensure that they receive support available to deal with the trauma they suffered.
