Media houses were on Wednesday afternoon barred from broadcasting, recording or taking images during Sandile Mantsoe's bail application hearing at the Johannesburg Magistrate's court. The groundbreaking ruling follows arguments from both the State and defence, which both argued against having the media present during court proceedings. Prosecutor John Metswamere, arguing for the State, wanted the media to be barred completely from proceedings. Metswamere argued that some witnesses may not wish to appear on camera and allowing the broadcast will lead to the identification of these witnesses. This view was supported by Mantsoe's defence, which argued that filming proceedings will result in the courtroom becoming a circus; much like Mantsoe's initial appearance. Furthermore, Mantsoe's lawyer argued that sensitive information contained in his affidavit could be revealed if the media is present. Magistrate Karel Labuschagne said he took these factors into account, as well as the rights of both the accused and victim. "To this end, it will be in the interests of justice to deny the request to broadcast the bail application hearing," he said. "No media house may broadcast, print, record or take any images during proceedings; only the judgment may be broadcast." The bail hearing is currently under way. IOL
