Cape Town – Mayor Patricia De Lille has made it clear that Cape Town will never be a water rich city again. De Lille on Wednesday called for a “New Normal” water resilient approach and said Capetonians will have to adapt to living with less water and not take water for granted. She said: “We cannot be sure whether it will rain this winter. We have gone through May with nothing much to show with regard to rainfall. “June might be better, but the point is we do not know. The confidence in weather prediction is low. “We need a new relationship with water.” Dam levels are currently sitting at a low 9.7%. Level 4B water restrictions may be implemented within the next 60 days. “Each of us must create our own personal water budgets. We must consider how long we are going to shower each day, how many times we are going to flush the toilet, and how much water we will use for cooking and cleaning,” De Lille said.     The City has now appointed its first Chief Resilience Officer, Craig Kesson, who will be looking at the city from a “shock drought” perspective and find a plan that will “rebalance risk”. They will also be looking at a Water Resilience Task Team and a Water Resilience Advisory Committee. In case of an emergency the City will be looking at modular waste water recycling and desalination. “If worse comes to worse, we will truck in water if we have to,” De Lille added. De Lille said the city was left with less than 9% of useable water in its dams. Each person per day must use 100 litres of water, she said. Other plans included increasing non-surface supply options. “These include drawing water from the Table Mountain Group aquifer and the Cape Flats aquifer and small-scale desalination at Koeberg, among other things.
