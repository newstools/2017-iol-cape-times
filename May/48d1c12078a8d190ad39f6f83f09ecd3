The party said it had been “flooded” with “desperate calls” from communities along the West Coast, Cape Town, Overberg, and the Southern Cape. “We are also aware of similar concerns from Northern Cape coastal communities. In the main the appeal has come from existing rights-holders in West Coast rock lobster who have been devastated by news of their unsuccessful applications. For example, in zone B, which includes the West Coast towns such as Lamberts Bay, Doring Bay and Elandsbaai, only 16 applicants out of 117 have been successful,” said the ANC provincial executive member Linda Moss. She said in total, only 75 applications from 800 existing rights-holders have been successful. “The fundamental flaw in this process is that DAFF has not declared what the total allowable catch (TAC) for this sector isNormally there is a consultation process regarding the TAC split every year,"  said Moss. Zokwana said last night his department was aware of unhappiness within the fishing sector and  he would be looking into it.
