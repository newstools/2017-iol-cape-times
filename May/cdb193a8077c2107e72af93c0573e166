A Facebook user could find herself in hot water after comments she made during a Facebook live broadcast were deemed to be racist by some Twitter: @users The live stream was of police clashing with protesters in Coligny, North West, who were reacting to two men being granted bail in the court case investigating the death of teen Matlhamola Jonas Mosweu. The men were granted bail on Monday. A number of civic organisations said on Sunday that they would protest if the men were set free. Magda Joubert posted on Facebook: "That boy kill himself he is 16 and so stupid to jump and now they blame the 2 white men for his stupid fault they didn't murdered him we must do the same when they kill the farmers then we must start killing them too (sic)." It had been reported that the teen had fallen from a moving vehicle while the men were transporting him to the local police station to report him for allegedly stealing sunflowers. However, an eyewitness last week told the court the boy had been pushed out of the moving vehicle, leading to his death. More than a thousand people attended Mosweu's funeral on Sunday. During the live broadcast Joubert commented on the feed: "We want a Marikana and Sharpville then the nonsens will stop SHOOT them if they can burn they can face a bullet" (sic). When she was called out about her comments, she responded: "Yes because how many blacks kill farmers every day did you saw that white people act like that and kill blacks in there houses and burn their houses NO NO NO" (sic). Her posts and comments were picked up on by Twitter user Deezo (@DonM0y0).
