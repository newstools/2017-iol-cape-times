On the night before her murder, Karabo Mokoena and her boyfriend reportedly had a heated argument in a nightclub in Sandton. The argument allegedly escalated into a physical fight. According to a Sunday Times report, Karabo left the club with her boyfriend, and was never seen alive again. Two days later a passerby reportedly found her body in an open veld in Bramley. She had been burnt beyond recognition. The Sunday Times reports that acid was poured over her. Karabo's boyfriend, Sandile Mantsoe, 22, who is a forex trader, faces charges of premeditated murder and defeating the ends of justice. A source told the Sunday Times that Mantsoe claims Karabo was alive when he left her in his apartment, but he panicked when her returned to find her dead. He allegedly claimed that he was afraid people would blame him for her murder, and panicked. Mantsoe allegedly told police how he disposed of the young woman's body. "He said he stuffed her body into a bin, rolled it out and into his gold BMW and drove to his family home in Lyndhurst, in southern Johannesburg. He picked up a tyre, acid and a container and drove to a filling station to buy petrol, which he used to douse Karabo's body in Bramley, where he buried her body." According to Karabo's family, CCTV footage from Mantsoe's flat shows the couple arriving after 1am. Mantsoe leaves shortly afterwards, wearing a change of clothes. He comes back, but then leaves again. When he returns again, he bring a waste bin with him. Karabo's uncle says the CCTV footage shows Mantsoe and members of his family leaving the flat with what appears to be linen and towels. At around 2pm Mantsoe allegedly left the flat with the body. IOL
