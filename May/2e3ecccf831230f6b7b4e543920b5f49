Briefing Parliament's portfolio committee on communications, parliamentary legal adviser Anthea Gordon said she was not in a position to name those who allegedly lied, but confirmed a report would be handed to the legislature by June 5. "We not in a position to name...but administratively from our side that process is underway," said Gordon. The parliamentary legal services were tasked with identifying people who reportedly lied during the SABC inquiry for possible criminal charges to be laid against individuals. The recommendation was one of many following the inquiry which lifted the lid on the shambolic state of affairs at the broadcaster, which continues to bleed money as a result of failed policies and a breakdown of governance. During the inquiry MPs heard contradictory evidence, with some MPs accusing former Communications Minister Faith Muthambi, former SABC board chairpersons Ben Ngubane and Mbulaheni Maguvhe of lying to the inquiry.
