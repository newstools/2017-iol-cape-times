The search for Courtney Peters has extended into its seventh day and, despite following up leads since last week, family and community members are no closer to finding the missing three-year-old. Courtney went missing on May 4 and was last seen on the corners of Grand View Avenue and Pluto Road in Elsies River. The distraught mother, Juanita, spoke emotionally about her experience so far but remains hopeful her daughter will be found.   Residents, neighbourhood watches and police have continued the search despite being told by police they are only able to "pick up the search on Friday again". Chairperson of the Manenberg Safety Forum Roegshanda Pascoe supported the family on Wednesday morning saying they will not be deterred by the lack of service delivery by the police.  Anyone with information is requested to contact Warrant Officer Lawrence on 079 894 0107 or the Elsies River SAPS on 021 933 0308. Cape Times reporter Chevon Booysen gives us an update on the search for the missing Courtney.
