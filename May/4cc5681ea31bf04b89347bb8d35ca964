Dam levels now stand at 22.8% which is 0.6% less than a week ago with the remaining 10% being mostly unusable. Mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services and energy Xanthea Limberg said: “The severity and scale of drought episodes is increasingly difficult to predict and our relationship with water must change as this is something that we can control. We need to save water irrespective of the weather.” Extensive pressure reduction programmes to reduce the flow of water is planned, as well as reducing water losses through leakage in the pipework of the distribution system. The regulation of supply is under way in the central, southern and eastern suburbs and by next week will be expanded to the northern suburbs. Department of Water and Sanitation spokesperson Sputnik Ratau said the latest dam levels assessments for the province show dam levels are declining. Provincially, the situation is just as dire as in the municipality, “The combined average dam levels for the Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS) are at 21.36% as compared with 30.57% at the same time last year. "Our dams continue to experience over 1% week by week decline which is a concern to water security,” said Ratau. The department has appealed to all water users to reduce water use as this will stretch water security until winter rainfall and restrictions will remain until the dams fill up to 85%.
