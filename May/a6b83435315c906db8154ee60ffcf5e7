Johannesburg – The South African Cabin Crew Association
(SACCA) will be in court to ask the court to allow it to continue striking this
week. This follows last week’s strike by crew over international meal
allowances, which saw several flights delayed of cancelled because flight
cannot legally be in the air without crew. SACCA wants daily meal allowances raised from $131 a day
to $170. The strike came to an end last Wednesday when SAA
successfully applied for a court interdict at the Labour Court, which declared
the industrial action unprotected
strike action. The
court ordered that the strike action should end immediately. This
allowed SAA to substantially recover its operations. Last
Thursday, SAA said, since the court order was granted, it has seen a
significant increase in several cabin crew members reporting for duty, which enabled
the airline to operate all its scheduled flights for today. Read also: #SAAStrike: 38 flights cancelled A total
of 50 flights were cancelled for the entire day on Wednesday. The biggest
impact was on the domestic segment of the route network and SAA cancelled only
one outbound international flight. At the
time, the airline said its board was committed to further engaging with SACCA through a facilitated dispute
resolution process over the next two months. SACCA,
which was not immediately available on Wednesday, has said it is open to
negotiations. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
