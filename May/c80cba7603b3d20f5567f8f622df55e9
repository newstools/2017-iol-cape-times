Now a 38-year-old man, who rented a room inside Courtney's family home, has been fingered as the prime suspect in her death and disappearance. He has gone on the run since her body was discovered at Bofors Circle in Epping Industria. Yesterday, the police’s K9 unit descended on the house, seeking clues to the disappearance and death of the 3-year-old girl. Manenberg Crisis Forum chairperson Roegshanda Pascoe supported the family on Saturday and yesterday, ahead of a scheduled wreath-laying ceremony at the scene. Courtney’s mother had the harrowing task, on Mothers Day, of identifying her child's body at Tygerberg mortuary. A 200-strong search party gathered in Elsies River on Saturday morning in hopes of finding the girl who went missing on May 4. But a team from Delft, who helped in the search, made the shocking discovery when they saw a foot poking out from under the sand at just after 1pm. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk confirmed the investigation is ongoing.  He refused to be drawn into speculation around the circumstances of Courtney’s death.
