Provincial police spokesperson Sergeant Noloxiso Rwexana said  yesterday  a case of murder was under investigation after 13 people playing football outside a block of flats were shot by the occupants of a car driving by. Elsies River resident Michael Fortuin was shot dead inside his home. The suspects of the shootings were being sought on charges of murder and attempted murder, with investigations continuing, she said. Anyone with information which may assist the investigation is requested to contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111, or Sergeant Kleinbooi at 082 302 9938.

Elsies River Community Policing Forum deputy chairperson Imraahn Mukaddam said the CPF condemned the “blatant attacks” on their community and innocent civilians. The people who were shot were not affiliated to gangs.“Our view is that (the shootings) were not a case of mistaken identity, but a display of force by one group of the armed militias in the area.” He said communities demand a comprehensive intervention.  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
