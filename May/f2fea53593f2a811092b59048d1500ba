The three-year-old went missing at about 8am on Thursday from the corner of Grand View and Milky View avenues. The search intensified with three teams of people searching the area yesterday morning after the police’s K9 Unit was dispatched to the area on Sunday evening when residents were alerted to an “overwhelming stench” at a plot on Grand View Avenue. The vacant plot found on the corners of Pluto Road and Grand View Avenue was covered in rubble. The stench was revealed to be that of a decomposed dog  after the Goodwood waste department sent out a digger to help clear rubble on the field. Mitchells Plain Crisis Forum chairperson Joanie Fredericks, who supported the Peters family at their home in Pluto Street, says they were upset by the delay of police to get the dog unit to the open field. “We were alerted by residents of the smell coming from the field. We immediately went there and called police. We called at about 4pm and were told to not search the area until police arrived,” she says. Police cordoned off the area and waited for the dog unit to arrive. The unit arrived after 7pm to a cheering crowd. Yesterday, Fredericks said she wanted to raise “all sorts of hell in the media” to ensure the safe return of the toddler, calling for a thorough search to be conducted by police. Shift commander Captain Edward Fick, from Elsies River police station, confirmed the plot searched on Sunday evening had been searched by residents on Saturday evening as well, but nothing was found. Community Police Forum secretary Danny du Plessis said plans were being discussed with police on a way forward. “We conducted door-to-door searches in the community (yesterday). So far we have nothing yet,” Du Plessis said. Courtney was last seen wearing a white-and-yellow T-shirt, blue shorts and was barefoot. *  If you have any information, contact Elsies River Police Station on 0219330308 or 0798940107.
