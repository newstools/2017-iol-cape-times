The terms - for people who create and star in online videos - would probably not be recognised by some grandparents. But more than three-quarters of youngsters say theyâ€™d consider a career in online videos, according to a survey of 1000 children aged six to 17. The research, by travel firm First Choice, revealed that 34% of children would like to be a YouTube personality, while one in five wished to start their own channel. Traditional career choices, such as teaching, were much less popular. The research also revealed that children would rather learn how to use video editing software instead of studying traditional subjects such as maths and history. They also displayed a strong interest in technology, with a third saying they would like to increase their knowledge of computer programming. - Daily Mail
