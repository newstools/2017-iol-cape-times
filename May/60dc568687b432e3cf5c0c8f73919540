Police spokesperson, Colonel Priscilla Naidu, said that it was alleged the woman was raped in broad daylight by the group of up to seven men about a month ago. "It is alleged that on the 20th of April at about 14:30, the 21-year-old victim and her friend were walking in Voisen Street when she was grabbed by a group of men," Naidu confirmed. Naidu said the men left the friend and allegedly took the woman to a shack at the back of a house. Between five to seven men allegedly raped the woman. Late on Thursday night, three suspects, between the ages of 22 and 24, were arrested by the police's Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS), assisted by the Visible Gang Intervention Unit. The men were arrested in the same street were the alleged rape incident occurred. Naidu said that a firearm was also recovered. The three men are expected to appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court on Monday on rape charges. Police said that more arrests were imminent. ANA
