Franziska went missing in the Tokai Forest in Cape Town while jogging with her mother on March 7, 2016. Her naked body was found during a search in the fynbos. She had been been raped before being murdered. Oliver, 28, is currently on trial in the Western Cape High Court facing two charges of rape, and one of robbery and murder. He previously pleaded not guilty to the rape and murder charges, but admitted to attacking and robbing the teenager of her cellphone. Earlier this month, Oliver’s previous lawyer Ken Klopper withdrew from the case. He said he had received contradictory statements which would not allow him to continue with the case.  “It is ethics,” he told the court. On Tuesday the State asked the court to hand Oliver a life sentence for Franziska's rape and murder, and an additional 15 years for robbery under aggravated circumstances. Judgement is expected on Wednesday. IOL
