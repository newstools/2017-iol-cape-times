Speaking at Karabo's funeral service, Dlamini said the number of women being killed was the equivalent of femicide.    "This must be a lesson to all of us. Stop politicising issues that affect us on a daily basis because we're misleading children. This abuse and violence can happen to anyone regardless of affiliation, status in society, or location," she said. â€œA 22-year-old is at their prime, no one must come cut that life. Men, this must come to an end."       Karabo will be laid to rest at the Westpark Cemetery in Johannesburg on Friday.
