In an emotional but celebratory memorial service, organised by the Social Justice Coalition (SJC), Khayelitsha Development Forum, local police management and the community police forum (CPF), at Noluthando School for the Deaf in Khayelitsha, neighbours and family paid their respects to the infant. The toddler was rushed to the Khayelitsha Day Hospital earlier this month, where she was declared dead after her father, Ntuthuzelo Mayekiso, apparently told his mother that the girl was not breathing. The infant’s mother, Bukelwa Kota, said the family were getting support from the community but she was still heartbroken over the incident. “We still have lot of questions but no answers,” said Kota. She said she hoped that the child’s father, who is in custody, would be able to attend Lindokuhle’s funeral today. Kota said she would have also loved to attend the court case but could not as she had to bury Lindokuhle. The SJC’s head of safety and justice, Chumile Sali, said it was sad that children were being killed and abused by people who were expected to safeguard them. He said various organisations were planning a summit to discuss crime in Khayelitsha in order to combat criminal activities. “We keep going to court hoping that things will change, but they don't. Every day we attend court cases of women and children who have been raped. It's painful,” said Sali. Lingelethu West CPF secretary Lusanda Jonas said men should take centre stage in the planned summit and should attend in their numbers.
