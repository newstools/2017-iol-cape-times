A 17-year-old allegedly stabbed Phillips in the chest outside a convenience store near his father’s house in 
Salamander Street in Hout Bay. A family member spoke to the Cape Times, requesting their identity be withheld due to threats received from acquaintances of the suspect. “Our family has been broken by this, but even more we are frustrated and feel the justice system has let us down. "Because he (the suspect) is a minor, only his mother was allowed in court and we had to follow up with officials ourselves to get information,” said the family member. The family resorted to an online crowd-funding campaign, Justice for Junaid, as Phillips’s parents were divorced and he was the breadwinner. The family felt the assistance of legal adviser Clement Abrahams from Nordien Law and the campaign were their only response to a “failing justice system”. “We were informed that the DNA evidence was not finalised, which was shocking as Junaid was murdered in January. "The prosecutor informed us the case was postponed until June 8 as the court awaits the results,” said the family member. The family were receiving counselling from an NGO, but it had been especially difficult for Phillips’s mother, who had become “completely withdrawn” and refused counselling, said the family member. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk confirmed that the case docket was  at court and said inquiries should be directed to the National Prosecuting Agency (NPA). NPA spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the State prosecutor had confirmed the DNA evidence was not finalised and the inquiry must be with the Health Department. Health Department spokesperson Robert Daniels said DNA took at most a week to process and the forensic department rarely had any backlog. They family have been granted consent to protest in front of the Wynberg court on June 8 and their campaign can be followed at www.backabuddy.co.za/justice-for-junaid.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
