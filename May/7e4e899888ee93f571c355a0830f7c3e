Yende's body was discovered at an Eskom substation in Springs after she was reported missing two weeks ago. It is alleged that 30-year-old Yende was last seen when she went to her workplace in Springs late in the evening on May 17. Yende's family went to the police station to report her missing after she did not return home and was not answering her phone. The power utility said it was working closely with the South African Police Services (SAPS) to establish the circumstances under which she died. Eskom group executive for human resources, Elsie Pule, conveyed the power utility's "deepest condolences to the Yende family who have lost their loved one and join the family in mourning". "When we heard that Thembi had gone missing we worked closely with the family and the SAPS. We are saddened by her tragic death," Pule said in a statement. "Eskom will continue to work with the SAPS and the family in seeking to determine what has led to the tragic loss of our colleague. Eskom will continue to support the family with counselling and in any other way possible." The matter is currently under investigation by the SAPS and a post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause and time of death. "We pray that her soul rests in peace and that God gives her family, colleagues and friends strength during this difficult time," Pule said. Police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele appealed to anyone who might have information to come forward by contacting the nearest police station, and encouraged members of the community to report criminal activities.
