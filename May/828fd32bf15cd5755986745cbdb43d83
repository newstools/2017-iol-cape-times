Another Western Cape winery Klein Constantia received a Platinum Best in Show award for its Vin de Constance, one of the estate’s well-known sweet wines. More than 200 experts started the judging process for this year’s awards in London last month. Western Cape Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde congratulated both establishments for their wins at the Decanter World Wine Awards, which was one of the world’s largest wine competitions. “Over 17,000 entries were recorded for the 2017 Decanter World Wine Awards. Winning top awards at this competition speaks to the high quality of Paul Cluver and Klein Constantia’s wine offerings. Their wins are excellent promotion for our wine industry,” he said.
