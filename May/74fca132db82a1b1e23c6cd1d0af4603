The Beliebers are expected to start queueing outside the stadium from 10am with gates opening at 4pm, and the Canadian star is set to perform just before 9pm. Big Concerts, which has organised the show, have confirmed that local act Sketchy Bongo - who currently has a big hit Love Me In The Dark rocking the clubs and airwaves - will open for Bieber. Here are five fun things you may not know about Bieber: He loves onesies; He can solve a Rubik's Cube in less than two minutes; He loves the movie The Notebook; He visits a mall in every city he tours; He taught himself to play the trumpet, guitar, piano and drums. The City of Cape Town has advised residents and motorists around the stadium to take note of temporary road closures and plan accordingly. In addition, a free shuttle service will operate between the MyCiTi Civic Station and the Stadium Station. The first shuttle will depart at 4pm, and thereafter a bus will depart every 15 minutes or when full. The shuttle service will continue for the duration of the event and the last bus will depart from the stadium at 12.15am. The shuttle service will be free on presentation of a valid event ticket.
