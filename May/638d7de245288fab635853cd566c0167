Just hours after police announced that two-year-old Inako Maxolo had been found in Kraaifontein yesterday, an appeal was sent for anyone with information that may lead to finding 14-year-old Taylin Basson from Lentegeur, Mitchells Plain. Taylin was last seen on Saturday at about 11am. She was wearing a black tracksuit top with the words “Westridge Swimming Club” and black tights. She has dark eyes, black hair and four upper teeth are missing. Inako had been missing for about 18 hours before he was found near a local taxi rank yesterday. He had been playing with friends. The boy was taken to a doctor for a check-up by the police special investigations unit that deals with such cases, and the Community Policing Forum is awaiting the report. Yesterday Social Development MEC Albert Fritz, who launched the department’s Child Protection Week commemoration with a door-to-door awareness campaign in Mitchells Plain, said he was concerned about the spike in reports of missing children in the Western Cape and across the country. He said they wanted to make people active around the issue of child protection, and that the community needed to take back their streets. “There are people who have become predators targeting our children. We have seen the horrific crimes committed against women in the last couple of weeks. “All of us can play a role in protecting children and their rights,” he said. Meanwhile, Kraaifontein CPF chairperson Mawethu Sila said they had raised the alarm over Inako via WhatsApp, and a search had been activated to find him. “It helped, because the community found the child not far from the Wallacedene taxi rank and informed the police. The important thing is that he was still alive,” said Sila. Anyone with information that could help locate Taylin is requested to call investigating officer Sheldon at 021 377 5029 or Crime Stop at 08600 10111. Information can also be given to Pink Ladies at 072 214 7439, 083 378 4882 or 072 620 7704.
