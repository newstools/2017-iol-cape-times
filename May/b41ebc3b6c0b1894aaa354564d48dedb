Motshekga said the remodelled assessment was now called the National Integrated Assessment Framework (NIAF), which will be administered only for Grades Three, Six and Nine, every three years. “This will provide the basic education sector, especially those involved in planning and evaluation, with valuable data on the health of 
the system and trends in learner performance,” she said when she presented 
her budget in Parliament 
yesterday. She said the remodelled assessment would be piloted in October 2017, and implemented in 2018. “Consultations with our social partners are set to be concluded by the end of June 2017 on the diagnostic assessment and summative examination,” Motshekga said. She also said the new model for national assessment would give the department ample time to remediate before the next assessment. “The assessment overload is obviated by the administration of the national assessment in selected Grades - 
and not on an annual basis,” she said. Speaking to the media before the budget presentation, Motshekga said a costed project plan for implementation in the next three years was approved last year by director-general Mathanzima Mweli. The department has for years been criticised by teacher unions over the administration, the frequency and other concerns with regards to the ANAs.
