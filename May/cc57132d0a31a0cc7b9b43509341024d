Community-based organisation Parkscape last year approached the Western Cape High Court after SANParks and MTO Forestry started felling some of the pine trees. Parkscape had been lobbying for the trees to be spared the axe, while SANParks and MTO wanted to reintroduce the indigenous and critically-endangered fynbos. “On advice of its legal team, SANParks is applying for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal on the grounds that there is reasonable prospect of success,” SANParks spokesperson Merle Collins said. Because of financial constraints, Parkscape had chosen not to oppose the application. @4everSiya siyabonga.sesant@inl.co.za Cape Argus
