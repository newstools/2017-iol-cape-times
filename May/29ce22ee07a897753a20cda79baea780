Howdy Kabrins was due to be called as the first State witness in the trial against Guatemalan murder accused Diego Novella, which started on Monday. The family flew in from the US last week to attend court proceedings, but instead both of the 39-year-old American marketing executive’s parents spent hours waiting outside court as they are both expected to take the stand. Judge Vincent Saldanha insisted that Novella go through all the crime scene photographs and documents, contained in two Lever Arch files, before proceeding with witness testimony. He wanted to make sure Novella was satisfied with admissions handed in by his defence lawyer, William Booth. Judge Saldanha also issued a warning to journalists that the photographs of the crime scene were “extremely explicit and may upset people who see it”. Novella was rattled by the fact that the photographs become public documents once handed in as evidence, and may be published. Addressing the judge, he asked what the benefit of publishing them would be. Judge Saldanha said: “The benefit for the media of course is that they find it newsworthy. Documents are part of the public record.” The case was adjourned until today to give Booth time to go through the exhibit bundles with his client. Novella has pleaded not guilty to  murder. Novella was arrested on July 29, 2015, after his girlfriend’s body was discovered in the hotel room they were sharing at Camps Bay Retreat Boutique Hotel. The hotel room was in complete disarray.
