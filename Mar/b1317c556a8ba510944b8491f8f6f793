The 46-year-old driver was shot and killed at 5.20am on Tuesday in Symphony Way, Philippi East, according to police spokesperson Andre Traut. The shooting follows that of another taxi driver, who was shot dead on Sunday at the Delft taxi rank by an unknown suspect. Motives for both shootings, for which there have no arrests, have not been determined, according to Traut, who said the circumstances were being investigated. He added that the 46-year-old driver had been able to drive for a few metres before he lost control of his taxi and drove into a wall. In a different incident, a suspect has been arrested following Sunday’s gang-related fatal shooting of a man at Worcester’s Riverview flats. The shooting was captured on video and circulated 
on social media by a person who requested to remain anonymous. Referring to that shooting, Traut said: “This office can confirm that the circumstances surrounding a murder in Worcester are being investigated after a man was fatally wounded.” He added that a 24-year-old was arrested for the murder and was due to appear in the Worcester Magistrates’ court today. Worcester CPF chairperson Russell Cupido said: “It is always tragic when there is loss of life in any incident and even more when a young person is gunned down in cold blood. “This incident is but the tip of the iceberg. "We cannot afford to keep losing so many of our young men to this senseless violence that holds our communities in the grip of fear and does so much damage to the psyche of our communities.”  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
