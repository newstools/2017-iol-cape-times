And in the early hours of Monday morning police arrested nine suspects found in possession of dagga with a street value of R680000 in Wellington. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said the circumstances around the murder of the taxi driver were being investigated after the 40-year-old was shot and killed at 6.20am at the Delft taxi rank. He said a suspect was yet to be arrested. “The motive is still to be determined,” he said. The gang war shooting, which a bystander captured in a video clip that has since gone viral, was confirmed by police spokesperson Frederick van Wyk. “At about 11.15 am on Sunday Worcester SAPS attended to a complaint of a shooting incident at Riverview Flats, Worcester. “On arrival at the scene, the (police) members found the 20-year-old victim, who had sustained several gunshot wounds to the left side of his back. “The victim died on the scene,” he said. Van Wyk said the circumstances surrounding the incident was unknown. Traut, in referring to the Wellington dagga haul, said the police’s Boland K9 Unit arrested nine suspects early yesterday after they were found with 29 bags of dagga weighing 460kg. He said the unit had spotted a minibus taxi under suspicious circumstances on Klipheuwel Road and stopped the vehicle for a routine inspection, which led to the discovery of the dagga. “The dagga, with an estimated street value of R680000, was confiscated and the nine suspects, between the ages of 25 and 45, were arrested,” he said. They were due to appear in court in Wellington on a charge of dealing in drugs, said Traut. He added that the circumstances surrounding the matter were under investigation.
