It started in a group chat that a friend was added to by her boyfriend. She was the only girl in the group and he told her that she could not add us because this group was only for her, him and his friends. She was in love with him and she thought that he was in love with her. He took advantage of that, and used the threat of breaking up to get her to do what he wanted, and send explicit pictures to the group. He said that she could trust him, so she sent them. Soon those pictures were all over social media. This is not an isolated incident. It mostly seems to happen to girls. Last week, when #Sesethu was trending, this issue was highlighted because an explicit video of a teenage girl had gone viral. This could happen to anyone and anyone could be a perpetrator. In our experience it is something that is common in relationships. Even outside of so-called loving relationships, the pressure to produce such content is difficult to manage. This is alarming because it shows the imbalance of power in relationships; we have yet to see such a video or picture of a boy in the same position. We think that the direct approach is the best approach when dealing with this issue. Love does not mean that anyone should be able to tell you to do things that you are not comfortable doing, and girls in particular should remember it. Communication, especially about sexual matters, must be open and honest. It is important that both partners in the relationship feel, and are, respected. Gossiping is never acceptable. Reporting photos and videos of this nature is another way of showing people that the distribution of such material is unacceptable and illegal. Setting personal boundaries is useful. Do not talk to strangers online, post content that you would not be scared to show your parents and try to create an environment where your friends can tell you when they think you have posted inappropriate content. Also, check privacy settings.
