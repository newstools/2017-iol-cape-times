Warm, courageous, compassionate and resolute – these were the words South Africa Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is also the founding chairman of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, used to describe the anti-apartheid stalwart following his death on Tuesday. “He will be remembered as an unassuming freedom fighter, whose wisdom, tolerance, humility, steadfastness and humour earned him the love and respect of our people,” Ramaphosa said in a statement. “After his release from prison, after the achievement of democracy and the adoption of a new democratic Constitution, even as others contemplated retirement, Kathy was determined to continue to serve the people.” Ramaphosa extended his condolences to Kathrada’s wife Barbara, his family and friends. “Your love and support sustained him through a lifetime of service, sacrifice and struggle.” The Deputy President said the foundation named after Kathrada would “cement his legacy as a resolute champion of non-racialism, reconciliation and nation building”. “His dedication, through the Foundation, to the development of a new generation of young leaders will ensure that his impact on the development of a new, better society will endure for years to come,” said Ramaphosa. “As we mourn the passing of Ahmed Kathrada, we celebrate a life that was lived in the service of humanity. As we prepare to lay his mortal remains to rest, we are reminded of our solemn duty to live by his example and to complete his work.” – African News Agency (ANA)
