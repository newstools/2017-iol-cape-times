Born with an underdeveloped left arm, the young man attends Paarl School for special needs children in Brackenfell and, after being introduced to athletics in 2015, has never looked back. This year, Boltman is preparing to participate in his third SASAPD championships, having previously won gold in the 100m, 200m, javelin and shot-put events. His father Derend Boltman, a caretaker at a school in Wellington, says the family is struggling to get funding to send Benade to this year's event. “I didn't even know he could (run), let alone had an interest in athletics, and he never ran with spikes on a rubber surface before his first meeting in Coetzenberg stadium in Stellenbosch in 2015. ‘‘No one could believe it when he was selected to represent Western Province after his first race in the 100 metres, let alone chosen to go to the national event,” said Boltman. A former marathon runner himself, Boltman said his son has the potential to reach greater heights but would require help as they have only raised half of the required funds. Benade said he has never considered himself to be different and, with his athletics, he has dreams to go as far as possible. “I want to do my best and hopefully win my races and perhaps even break more records. Eventually I will be in a position for national colours and, if I work hard, go to the Paralympics one day,” said Benade. He said he also harbours dreams of competing against able-bodied
 athletes and hopes someday to represent South Africa at the Olympics. The family has acquired  half of the R6000 they need for Benade's trip to PE.  Anyone wishing to assist can contact the family on 083 610 7990 or 021 873 4844.    dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
