They pulled off a huge robbery without a single shot being fired in what is considered to be one of the biggest at OR Tambo International Airport. However, others believe the robbery could not have taken place without the assistance of airport personnel. Former head of security at Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) Paul O’Sullivan claims the robbery was an inside job. “During my time as head of security, the airport had about 16 000 employees with access permits, making it hard to keep track of all of them to prevent a security breach,” he said. He was speaking to sister newspaper The Star on the backdrop of a robbery that took place on Tuesday night which saw a gang making its way into the airport and stealing millions in foreign currency. “There were a number of robberies that took place at airports that are similar to this; in most cases one would find that someone on the inside was involved,” said O’Sullivan. Security at the airport was yesterday beefed up with private security guards stationed at various sections. Police presence appeared to have been increased. Acsa said in a statement that at 7.23pm, a bakkie with what appeared to be police markings pulled up at a restricted access gate. It was closely followed by a white Ford Focus. Both vehicles had sirens and blue lights activated. The vehicles were occupied by several armed men, some of whom were in police uniforms. “When requested to validate their credentials, the men produced firearms, rounded up security staff in the security checkpoint and ordered them to lie on the floor.” The robbers proceeded to gain access to the side of the airport where they removed an undisclosed amount of money from a sealed container. No shots were fired. Additional reporting by Ilanit Chernick
