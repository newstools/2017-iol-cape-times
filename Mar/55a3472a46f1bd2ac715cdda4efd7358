This week the team, consisting of pupils from schools in Paarl and Strand, flew to Monaco. The trip has been made possible through the joint efforts of the South African Rugby Legends Association (Sarla), The Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation and Cell C. The team also received new kit before their departure. Sarla president Gavin Varejes said: “This is the third year that SA has sent a team to participate in this tournament, and it is a venture that has gone from strength to strength. ‘‘These exceptional young players get so much from the experience, and we wish our 2017 team the best of luck. We know you will do SA proud.” Varejes said the objective of the tournament was to highlight the values that participation in a sport like rugby has - fellowship, camaraderie, friendship, fun, good sportsmanship, as well as a chance to meet and engage with youth. In 2015, the first year of the tournament, Sarla fielded a team from Orchards Primary School in Johannesburg. The 2016 team was selected in association with the JAG Foundation’s Rugby project in Cape Town from schools in Bonteheuwel. Sarla chief executive Stefan Terblanche said: “At Sarla, our business is rugby, but it is a wonderful honour to make dreams a reality for rugby-loving kids in South Africa. "I have no doubt that this year`s tournament will again be a dream come true for the 12 boys. As it’s a 7s tournament, we are privileged to have the support of Blitzboks coach Neil Powell and 7s Academy and Elite squad manager Marius Schoeman,” said Terblanche. The young players will also be treated to a variety of fun activities in the principality. They will meet Princess Charlene at two events - one is at the pool where the boys will receive a masterclass in water safety, and at a cultural-exchange programme with local youth. The teammates were also surprised at their hotel by Springbok legend Bryan Habana. The Sainte Dévote Tournament takes place tomorrow at Stade Louis II. The team will head home on Monday.
