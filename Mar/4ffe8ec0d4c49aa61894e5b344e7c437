During early-morning peak time, commuters left stationary trains in search of alternative transport. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said faulty cables between Hazendal and Athlone added 50-60 minutes travelling time on the Cape Flats line. On the Central line, signal head-and-cable theft in the Bontheuwel-Netreg-Heideveld “throat” affected service to Sarepta, Kapteinsklip and Chris Hani. “Several trains were slowed by preceding defective trains; extending normal trip durations. Metrorail was forced to cancel trains to prevent congestion on the line,” Scott said. “Maintenance and repairs in this area is threatened by volatile gang activity and technical crews require security/police escorts. Delays in excess of 60 minutes were experienced.” On the Southern Suburbs line, trains had to be authorised manually between Steenberg and Fish Hoek. Revised work operations on Tuesday afternoon should have shortened delays but will remain in force for the next few months, Scott said. Defective signals near Paarl, Brackenfell and Kraaifontein contributed to 15-20 minute delays on the Northern line. Scott said technicians are on-site in all affected areas with most repair work set to be concluded on Tuesday.   Commuter Kurt Volkwyn said: “I got to the station (at) 7.30am. The train arrived at 7.33am and was so packed, you couldn’t get in. When the train left, (it did) not even (travel) 500 metres, the train stood and was still standing for another half an hour. People eventually got out.  “There was no announcement, no answers coming from the guy at the ticket box, people were asking what was happening, no one could reply. People were getting frustrated, because you know nothing, so what do you tell your boss now?”  lisa.isaacs@inl.co.za
