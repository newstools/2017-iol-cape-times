Although the Department of Water and Sanitation has lifted water restrictions in Gauteng municipalities, the City of Joburg on Wednesday said it would only “partially lift” the restrictions to save water. “South Africa remains a water scarce country and the City of Joburg remains a net importer of water. We urge all water users to maintain vigilance in conserve this scarce resource. The risk of demand outstripping supply in the intervening period between now and the commissioning of Phase II of the Lesotho Highlands Project (2025) remains a real threat,” the municipality said. “According to the 2009 Phase II feasibility report, the full yield is expected to be utilised by approximately 2030. Therefore the city will, in an effort to maintain a culture of water conservation, only partially lift Level 2 water restrictions.” A level 2 restriction prohibits consumers from using hose pipes to clean paved ways, driveways using municipal water. Watering gardens and irrigation is also prohibited between between 6am and 6pm. The city said law-enforcement would police the restrictions. The Johannesburg Metropolitan Department (JMPD) has issued at least 665 fines to consumers since the inception of water restrictions since 2015, the city said. – African News Agency (ANA)
