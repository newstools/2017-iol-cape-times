Proposals to reimagine the notorious unfinished highways on the Foreshore include an ambitious 65-storey tower to rival some of the world s largest monuments, and 4000 affordable residential units.Yesterday, the City unveiled six proposals received from the private sector for the development of the Foreshore Freeway Precinct in the CBD. The submissions are currently on display at the Civic Centre.The 65-storey tower would utilise green initiatives like solar panels, drawing water from the ocean for irrigation and air conditioning.Another proposal promises to provide 4 000 affordable residential units, while another promises a 4 500-unit residential development for up to 15 000 people. The other proposals include an initiative to raise the housing development, with road works running beneath to alleviate traffic congestion.Yet another proposal will have parking outside the City borders with public transport and bike lanes promoted to alleviate the congestion. In June last year, the City called on the private sector to submit concepts for the unfinished highways on the western, central and eastern sides of the Foreshore.Mayco member for transport Brett Herron said the development would be on a scale never seen before in Cape Town and encouraged residents to see the exhibitions and give the City feedback.These comments will be collated by the multi-disciplinary bid evaluation committee (BEC), who will take the public comments into account as part of the extensive evaluation process to select the preferred bidder or bidders. The six proposals that we are now exhibiting at the Civic Centre were developed by professional urban designers and experienced specialists from the private sector. Importantly, the proposals are all self-funding, he said.The BEC will evaluate the six proposals over about four months, before announcing the qualifying bidder or bidders, who will sign an agreement with the City to set out the conditions and requirements to be followed. The next six-month phase will commence on the date of the signing of the agreement. During this time, the preferred bid will have to secure the financing for the project, determine phasing and dependencies, and refine the technicalities, said Herron.A formal review of the progress will take place after three months, and the qualifying bidder/s will have to provide the BEC with a detailed progress report.The City hopes the planning and approval processes for the development will be concluded within two years.Formal public consultation processes will take place during this time and as the project is implemented.Herron said the winning development must aim to alleviate traffic congestion and provide affordable, inclusive housing in the city centre.Mayor Patricia de Lille said that, besides being an eyesore, the unfinished freeway was preventing the development of prime City-owned land.The unfinished highways were the work of then City engineer Solly Morris, and later became known as Solly s Folly . In the 1970s, engineers designed the freeways, embarking on the roads project with a traffic flow not nearly at the level we are experiencing today. In July 2016 we issued a document called the Prospectus for the Development of the Foreshore, calling on interested parties to provide a solution to the congestion and provide affordable housing, said De Lille.She said the City s Integrated Development Plan set various objectives, such as leveraging its assets to drive economic and social development and job creation.
