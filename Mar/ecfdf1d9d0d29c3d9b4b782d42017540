The woman was seated next to her friend who also suffered the same calamity with her on October 17, 2015. They were flanked by social workers and the MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane. Yesterday, the South High Court gallery was packed with family members and journalists. They waited to hear the fate of three men who are part of a gang that accosted and robbed two couples while taking a stroll at Rhodes Park. Mduduzi Lawrence Mathibela, 33, Edmore Ndlovu, 24, and Thabo Nkala, 26, have been charged with robbery with aggravating circumstances, rape and murder. Only Mathibelaâ€™s DNA was found on one of the victims which tied him to the rape. Earlier, Mathibela aggressively left the dock when he was confronted by journalists taking pictures of him. He went down the stairs leading to the holding cells and was heard saying he will come up when the judge comes in. The judge is expected to go through all the testimonies before handing down his judgement. The matter was adjourned until today. - ANA
