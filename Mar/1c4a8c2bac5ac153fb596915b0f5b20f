According to a source close to the investigation, five men were arrested across Gauteng on Friday and Saturday. “One of them is a police officer, the other three are security who work at the airport, and a Zimbabwean national was also arrested,” said the source. This comes nearly a week after the Acting National Police Commissioner,  Khomotso Phahlane, announced that four suspects, including a police officer, were arrested. Two of the four men taken in at the time appeared in the Kempton Park magistrate’s court on charges of armed robbery. Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi could not confirm the arrests, but said he was aware of a message on social media about the arrests. “The information cannot be verified at this point, but the nation will be updated if there is a breakthrough in the case,” Mulaudzi said. A total of 27 parcels of foreign currency, apparently amounting to R20 million, were taken when armed robbers travelling in a SAPS branded vehicle accessed a restricted section of the airport.
