Following more than 100 successful drug busts in the province over the past month, police have urged people to contact Sanca (SA National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency) if they know of anyone who suffers from drug addiction. Since the start of last month, at least 120 busts have resulted in the arrest of 336 people in the Western Cape.The latest was in Tafelsig, Mitchells Plain, yesterday, where a suspect, 28, was arrested for being in possession of 87 Mandrax tablets. He is expected to appear in court today.Three days earlier, 14 000 Mandrax tablets with an estimated street value of R630 000 was found in a house in Gugulethu. The Hawks swooped and a 51-year-old suspect later appeared in the Athlone Magistrate s Court.Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: If you or anyone you know suffers from drug addiction, please contact Sanca to get information about your nearest rehabilitation centre. Addiction to drugs and alcohol fuels crimes such as domestic violence, assault, theft and robbery, because addicts are often desperate for money to support their habit. Help is available. Persons found in possession of illegal substances such as dagga or Mandrax will be criminally prosecuted. Sanca offers, among others, individual therapy, intensive group therapy, occupational therapy, and detoxification. Sanca can be contacted toll free on 086 147 2622.Four days ago the police s Boland K9 Unit and Crime Intelligence Gathering Unit acted on a tip-off that resulted in the arrest of two suspects cultivating dagga. Police seized 242 dagga plants and three bags of the drug.Anyone who want to report crime can contact Crime Stop on 086 001 0111. [email&#160;protected]
