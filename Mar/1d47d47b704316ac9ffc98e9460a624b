A senior Metrorail official was attacked at the Koeberg Depot this week when a robber overpowered him, stuck a firearm in his back and threatened to shoot him. Vernon Brynard’s cellphone and glasses were taken but he escaped unharmed. The 54-year-old said he was walking past an empty security office at the premises of Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) when he was attacked. “I am so grateful that he did not shoot me. My life is worth more than a cellphone,” Brynard said. This was the second time in 36 years of service that he was attacked. A group of men robbed him 18 months ago at Kraaifontein Station. “Myself and my colleagues fear for our lives every day when we get up to go to work. Our working environment has become extremely dangerous and it seems as (if) nothing is being done about it,” Brynard said. United National Transport Union general secretary Steve Harris said the union would submit its application to the Western Cape High Court next week to order that Prasa implement drastic safety measures. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said: “We are very concerned about the incident and it will be fully investigated. "As a responsible employer, Metrorail has a common law duty to provide a safe working environment. To this end, we will ensure that Mr Brynard is offered the full spectrum of employee assistance available to him to assist him in dealing with his ordeal.” Scott said Metrorail’s regional mobile and/or undercover resources are allocated according to priorities determined between Metrorail Protection Services and the police. “Proactive deployment of security resources is based on security intelligence, reactive measures in response to reported incidents," she said. "The matter will be raised during our weekly interaction with provincial SAPS and the Rapid Rail Response Unit to consider when deploying resources."
