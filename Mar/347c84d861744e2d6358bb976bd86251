State Security Minister David Mahlobo has assured Parliament that the government is ready for any protests by students at universities.Mahlobo was part of the security cluster of ministers answering questions in the National Council of Provinces yesterday. He said the government had pumped a lot of money into higher education, and that President Jacob Zuma had issued an instruction that no deserving poor student should be left out.According to Mahlobo, the amount of investment made into higher education should not be able to trigger protests.The country s universities were rocked by violent protests as clashes between students and the police erupted late last year. They were demanding free education for all, among other demands. The security cluster believes there should be no basis of protests in institutions of higher learning. As a security cluster, we continue to participate in the Inter-Ministerial Committee, led by Minister Jeff Radebe, on the stabilisation of higher education. Plans are in place for any eventuality, he said.IFP MP Mntomuhle Khawula said it appeared there was no intelligence to pick up any protests, and the government has been caught off guard in many instances. Every time your agencies follow incidents after they have happened, said Khawula.Mahlobo said as security agencies, information is collected and shared with other law-enforcement agencies. But sometimes the authorities did not follow up on the information given. It will be incorrect and disingenuous to blame the president who has prioritised education, through the ANC, he said.No government has made such large investments in higher education than this government. The National Treasury has warned that the funding must be matched with the results, and that students must complete their studies on time.
