At the current draw-down rate of dams, there are 113 days of usable water left in the metro.Last week a local disaster was promulgated in the Provincial Gazette, which is valid for three months, but can be extended month to month by notice.A council decision is not required.At the start of this week dam levels dropped to 31.5%, which is 1.6% down from a week ago. With the last 10% of a dam s water mostly not being usable, dam levels are effectively at 21.5%. In a statement the city said it may invoke emergency procurement procedures if required to expedite the emergency and accelerated water resource schemes. This declaration is not an excuse for our residents not to carry on reducing consumption. There are so many great water ambassadors.&quot;Without you, we would have been in more serious trouble. We thank the many residents and businesses who are working with us to save water, the statement said.Residents can contact the city via e-mail: [email&#160;protected] for queries or to report contraventions (evidence should be provided to assist the city s enforcement efforts) or they can send an SMS to 31373.
