A contract and a tender related to two R120 million state-of-the-art cancer radiotherapy machines that have stood idle in Durban s Addington Hospital for most of the past three years are being investigated by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane.Her spokesman, Oupa Segalwe, on Thursday confirmed the investigations, saying that both the original tender awarded to Techmed Africa and the subsequent maintenance contract with KZN Oncology Inc were being investigated.He has also confirmed that the public protector is investigating a contract awarded to a company called MediTech, which was apparently awarded a multimillion-rand IT contract.The public protector has merged these three investigations with another controversial 2012 tender where the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health leased a mobile clinic that consisted of a truck and trailer with basic X-ray machines and ultra sound machines for R52.5 million over three years.Both the IFP and the DA complained to the public protector about the R61 million tender that resulted in Msanzi Lifecare (Pty) Ltd leasing the mobile clinic to the department.It was reported in January 2015 that the KwaZulu-Natal Health Department had awarded the R61 million tender to two companies Mzansi Lifecare and Mobile Satellite Technologies.Mzansi Lifecare was created a mere 17 days before the tender ZNB 9281 / 2012-H was advertised in the Government Gazette in June 2012.Former KwaZulu-Natal Health Department head Dr Sibongile Zungu signed off on the lease in August 2013, agreeing that the department would pay Mzansi Lifecare R1.5 million every month until August this year to lease the vehicle without staff.
