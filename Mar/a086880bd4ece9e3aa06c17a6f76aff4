Shack dwellers left destitute after being violently removed from property at the centre of a land claim have been temporarily moved to a caravan park in Genadendal.The displaced community of an informal settlement in Bereaville, just outside Genadendal, were chased off the property after violent clashes with residents.Genadendal businessman Geoff Cloete joined the mobilisation of the Genadendal community to help the displaced shack dwellers. We received the news that the people would finally be allowed to return to their homes, under police supervision, to retrieve their belongings. They will now be set up at a popular camping site for the next two weeks, after which the site has been booked and a permanent solution must be found, said Cloete.He said they were not sure what would happen as frustrations and tensions were still running high. This could not have come any sooner as the community was dejected and felt abandoned by the officials. We were afraid tensions would spill over again if a solution was not found soon, said Cloete.Bereaville community member Charles August said the solution provided was the best for all as their community would not allow the shack dwellers to return. People have been saying things, making this something that it is not, and we know we are reclaiming our land. &quot;The municipality and government can do what they are elected to do, and we are executing our right to our land, said August.Theewaterskloof Municipality spokesperson Hugo Geldenhuys said one permanent solution being considered was a portion of farm 39 referred to as Madiba Park . For the time being the displaced people will stay at the caravan park, where the municipality will provide them with tents, water and sanitation. It was arranged that the displaced families could return to their former houses to remove their possessions and housing material, said Geldenhuys.He said the municipality would facilitate plans for the children to return to schools.Geldenhuys said community leaders, the municipality, a transformation committee and the national Department of Rural Development and Land Reform would meet within days to discuss a long-term solution.
