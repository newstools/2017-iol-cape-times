Former Gauteng Hawks head Major-General Shadrack Sibiya and Lieutenant-Colonel Leslie Maluleke turned to the high court in Pretoria in a bid to force the SAPS to pay for their upcoming criminal trial.The pair, together with former Hawks boss Anwa Dramat, are facing several charges, including seven of kidnapping, defeating the ends of justice and contraventions of the Immigration Act, following the rendition of several Zimbabwean nationals.They have appeared several times in the Pretoria Magistrate s Court and their case is to be transferred to the high court. All three have been released on bail of R5 000.Sibiya and Maluleke are asking the court to set aside a decision by the head of the Hawks Major-General Berning Ntlemeza, in which he refused their application for the police to pay their legal fees.Dramat, who is facing basically the same charges as Sibiya and Maluleke, however, got the green light from Ntlemeza for the state to pay his legal costs.The pair stated in papers before the court that it made no sense that Dramat s legal bills be footed while they were told to fund their own defence.Sibiya said in an affidavit before the court that the decision taken by Ntlemeza on June 22 last year, in which he declined their application for the payment of their legal fees, was unlawful and should be set aside.He and Maluleke wanted the court to order acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane to grant permission for the SAPS to pay their legal fees.Sibiya said that in terms of police standing orders, both he and Maluleke qualified to have their legal fees paid for by the police (taxpayer). Both of them were Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation employees when the alleged offences were said to have been committed. We are charged as co-accused for having allegedly committed certain offences while performing our official duties in the employ of the respondents (the police). At the time of the alleged commission of the offences, we acted in the execution of our duties under the scope of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation. Sibiya said they thus qualified for legal representation paid for by the police.They were charged in March last year and their case had been postponed from time to time to allow Sibiya and Maluleke to launch this application.This was after they unsuccessfully applied internally to have their legal fees paid for by the police.Sibiya said while qualifying for legal assistance, it was also clear that they were innocent. He made it clear that he was never present when the alleged offences took place, nor did he give anyone instructions regarding the rendition of the Zimbabwean nationals. My cellphone records can corroborate my version, he stated.Sibiya said it was not up to Ntlemeza to decline their application for legal assistance, as he was only permitted to make a recommendation in this regard to Police Minister Nathi Nhleko.The case was postponed for Ntlemeza and the minister to file their opposing papers.
