#FeesMustFall activist Bonginkosi Khanyile s first taste of freedom yesterday after six months behind bars was sweet.A beaming Khanyile arrived at the Durban University of Technology (DUT) to address a crowd around midday, a few hours after he had left Westville Prison.Khanyile was welcomed by throngs of supporters vying for hugs and photographs with him. Khanyile, himself a DUT student, was arrested during #FeesMustFall protests on September 27 and charged with incitement to commit public violence, illegal gathering, possession of explosives and dangerous weapons, obstructing traffic and causing a nuisance on public roads.He was denied bail in the Durban Magistrate s Court and lost his appeal there. He took his case to the Durban High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal but they, too, dismissed it.Eventually, advocate Dali Mpofu took his case to the Constitutional Court, where he was on Wednesday granted bail of R250.Khanyile yesterday described his time in custody as torture . The conditions were difficult. In prison you run the risk of suffering from depression. I was kept in isolation where you stay alone and it becomes very difficult, especially mentally, he said.Nonetheless, he managed to complete his exams and obtain distinctions while behind bars.He said the massive support he had received from his peers at DUT and others from as far afield as Swaziland, Brazil and France had kept him going.But he also said he did not think this was the last he would see of prison. Rest assured, you will see me on the picket line, he said.He remained resolute in his call for free higher education. As the generation of 2017, if we want free education to be a reality we must be prepared to sacrifice, he said, adding that he had been made aware of the current student grievances at DUT. If need be, if you agree with me, we must render DUT ungovernable once again, he told his supporters. You just have to give us a mandate. If you say we must fight, we must fight.
