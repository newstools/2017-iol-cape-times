Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday told Parliament he did not join the government to make money through fraudulent means, a direct response to ANC Youth League (ANCYL) accusations that he was guilty of a conflict of interest.Speaking in the National Assembly during question-and-answer time, IFP MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa asked Ramaphosa whether he was ready to call out the ANCYL for spreading &quot;fake news&quot;. #Ramaphosa wishes SAA good luck on a new strategy they're working on. .but SAA has been working on a new strategy since 1994. pic.twitter.com/6rxuwsakZG#Ramaphosa wishes SAA good luck on a new strategy they're working on. .but SAA has been working on a new strategy since 1994. pic.twitter.com/6rxuwsakZG Hloni Nyetanyane (@HloniNyetanyane) March 1, 2017</blockquote> In January, the ANCYL accused both Ramaphosa and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan of trying to collapse SAA so a company linked to him would benefit financially. Ramaphosa said he was in the process of engaging the youth league on the matter.&quot;I have told them that the matter they raised publicly was a lie, was a fabrication and as you say, fake news, because there is no truth that I am conducting business with SAA or any other company,&quot; he said.The deputy president said he disposed of all his shares in the Shanduka group in 2014, and therefore has no conflict of interest to declare under the executive ethics code.&quot;I did not leave business to come into government business, to come and conduct fraudulent business in government,&quot; Ramaphosa told MPs.&quot;I hold the view that if you want to make money, make money in business, do not come and make money dealing with government entities.&quot; African News Agency
