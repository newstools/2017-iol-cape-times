Nelson Mandela Foundation chief executive Sello Hatang, politician and Ahmed Kathrada Foundation board member Max Sisulu, close friend Barbara Hogan and Kathrada’s niece, Zohra, were some of the people seen walking in and out of the Joburg hospital where the ANC stalwart is being treated. Kathrada, 87, was admitted to the institution nearly three weeks ago to remove a clot from his brain. Although his condition was said to be stable post-surgery, it deteriorated after he contracted pneumonia as a result of post-surgery complications. According to the foundation's chief executive, Neeshan Balton, the pneumonia has affected both Kathrada’s lungs. “Despite appropriate medical care, his condition is deteriorating. He’s comfortable,” he said. “We continue asking for prayers during this period for Mr Kathrada and his family and friends.” Balton walked out of the hospital at about 7pm, while Sisulu and Hogan sat at the coffee shop talking as more people trickled in. Meanwhile, Hatang who had gone in to see the anti-apartheid activist earlier, said nothing much had changed. “Like, Neeshan said, it’s not looking too good,” he said. Kathrada’s friend and fellow comrade, Essop Pahad confirmed on the phone that he had been to the hospital to visit him, but would not comment further and referred all questions to his foundation. A prayer meeting for Kathrada will be held at the Nelson Mandela Foundation on Tuesday. The public has also been encouraged to post messages and videos of support on social media platforms and to look out for updates. Those wishing to send cards and flowers to show their support can leave them at the foundation’s office at the Signet Terrace Office Park at 19 Guinea Fowl Street, Extension 1 in Lenasia.
