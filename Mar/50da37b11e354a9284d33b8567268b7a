After four days of protesting and locking out teachers and pupils of Manenberg Primary School, the frustrated community members demanded to address Premier Helen Zille on Tuesday. One of the parents, Gillian Simmers, said the people of Manenberg wanted to get a 
definite answer from the provincial government and took their memorandum to the officials. “We wanted to speak to the premier, but they (provincial staff members) made us wait hours and kept saying someone would come. Finally an official from Community Safety came to take our memorandum, but we are disappointed that she (Zille) didn’t want to face us herself.” She said the parents had changed the padlocks on the school gates, but would allow normal schooling to proceed today. In February the premier, in her State of the Province address, said there would be a major urban renewal programme in Manenberg, which included education. The Western Cape Education Department confirmed it was discussing details with community partners and no final proposals had yet been made. Manenberg Primary School Governing Body member Soraya Samson said it was disappointing that children were not allowed to go to school, but their parents' frustrations were understandable. She said it was not right for government to force decisions upon people, the residents of Manenberg would stand against any decisions that disadvantaged their community. Community Safety spokesperson Ewald Botha said one of its officials received the memorandum and, once reviewed, would ensure it was distributed to the correct department.
