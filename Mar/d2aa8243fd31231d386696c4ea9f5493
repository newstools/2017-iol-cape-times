Despite growing calls for Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini to be fired or resign over the social pension grants contract scandal, she will hang on to her cabinet position.This is according to political analysts, commenting after President Jacob Zuma yesterday described calls for Dlamini s axing as premature.He said there was no way the country could fail to pay its pensioners and I would suggest that the nation should really calm down and wait for the date. Others are calling, for example, for the dismissal of the minister, but the date has not come. How do you judge a person before the event? I think it is somewhat worrying that people seem to be having preconceived ideas on the matter. I know 2 prominent lawyers who advised #SASSA on how to b fully compliant with ConCourt.

There is no culture of accountability, and as a result, ministers get away with not performing. Silke also said the danger as a result of inefficiency in the pension grant contract warranted drastic action against Dlamini. She must resign on her own accord or be asked to step aside. We need accountability across the board, he said.Another analyst, Ralph Mathekga, said the situation required &quot;symbolic consequence&quot; but the handling of the saga could not be resolved by getting rid of Dlamini. You must not single out the minister. It is bigger and involves more than one department. There is a lot of politics involved here. He said the department should have made plans and appointed a new service provider without disrupting the payment of grants to recipients next month.This, he said, did not take place because it appeared the political elite wanted CPS to continue to operate in paying out the grants or have the grants contract extended irregularly.Mathekga also said there was no willingness to correct things pointed out by the Constitutional Court when it ruled that the tender was invalid.Dlamini was due to appear before the standing committee on public accounts today.
