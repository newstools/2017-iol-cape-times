The Atlantis-born star is the reigning SA National Junior Men’s champion, and recently took bronze at the FMBA Trophy in Abu Dhabi. He has represented South Africa at the Junior Grand Prixs of Figure Skating in Germany, Poland and Estonia. In 2012 at the World Development Trophy he won gold in his category. The World Junior Figure 
Skating Championships take place in Taiwan from March 15 to 19, and Matthew will be up against 44 other male solo 
skaters. “This competition is about me achieving my goals and nothing else. This is the biggest competition I am participating in, and I am confident I will place in the top 40,” he said. As a child, Matthew was hyperactive and ice skating was one of the only things that calmed him down, said his mother Suzette. “I am extremely proud of Matthew. This has been a long journey for him and he worked very hard to achieve this milestone in his sporting career,” she said. Ice skating is not a major code in South Africa and Matthew, like many other skaters, relies on businesses to assist him financially in preparing for competitions. “Owing to the high costs of international and national participation, which generally have to be carried by the athlete's parents, we are requesting any financial and other assistance,” Suzette said. The regional chairperson of the SA Figure Skating Association, Dawn van der Riet, said Matthew coaches other young skaters, giving back to the sport what he has learnt over the years. “The skating fraternity are very proud of Matthew’s achievements as he has worked hard to get there. His example will be followed by all our skaters who aspire to achieve, and we have many younger skaters who we hope will get to this level in the future,” Van der Riet said.  francesca.villette@inl.co.za
