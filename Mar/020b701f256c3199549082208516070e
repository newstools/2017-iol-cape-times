Dawie Kriel, the man who posted a racist rant on Facebook over Diwali celebrations, will have to wait until later this month to find out his fate.Magistrate Themba Sishi on Friday first formally convicted Kriel, before he adjourned the matter to March 27 for sentencing. Kriel was convicted of crimen injuria.He had pleaded guilty for the charge on January 27, but Sishi said he had to ensure that Kriel had admitted all the elements of the crime.Sishi said: Everyone has the right to freedom from insulting, degrading and humiliating treatment. A screengrab of the message Dawie Kriel wrote, followed by an apology, before he deactivated his Facebook account.&nbsp;Arguing in mitigation of sentence, Kriel s lawyer, Logan Padayachee, said that his client was remorseful and had nothing against Hindus.Padayachee pointed out that his client had been in a 15-year common law marriage with an Indian woman. He urged the court to consider a suspended fine for sentence as his client as he was unemployed. This incident was borne out of anger because he lost two dogs because they ran away from the fireworks. Every year, Diwali fireworks celebrations in Durban become a major bone of contention between animal lovers and those who celebrate Diwali with fireworks.Diwali is the Hindu festival of lights, which for believers spiritually signifies the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, and hope over despair.On October 30, Kriel posted the comments denigrating Indians as devil worshippers and saying that they should go back to India.However, prosecutor Nkululekho Msiya said that Kriel had shown little or no remorse by choosing not to testify in court and expressing his remorse.Msiya said Sishi should not place much emphasis on Kriel s public apology made on radio. He said the fact that Kriel had two previous convictions for being in possession of an illegal substance, paying two admission of guilt fines totalling R300, showed that he had no respect for the law.He urged Sishi to consider a fine, coupled with a jail sentence in the event that he fails to pay. He urged Sishi to see the hurt carried by society because of his Facebook posting.Outside court DA and ANC supporters protested against Kriel. African News Agency
