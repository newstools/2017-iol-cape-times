Her mother and a man believed to be her mother’s lover have been charged in connection with reports made to the police on Friday - that the infant had been kidnapped during a hijacking - which now appear to have been false. The baby’s mother had initially told police that her child had been kidnapped during a hijacking. Following a large-scale search, her car was recovered in Montclair some hours after the “hijacking”, but the baby was still missing. Then police pulled over a car at the Mariannhill Toll Plaza on Sunday morning and found the baby with the man who is before court. The baby’s mother allegedly gave the man her car and her baby, voluntarily. The pair, who are not being named to protect the child, were granted bail of R1000 each in the Durban Magistrate’s Court. Public prosecutor Vaneshree Moodley said the charges of kidnapping had been withdrawn, and they would now face charges of fraud and defeating the ends of justice. Speaking outside court, National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Natasha Kara said the infant would probably remain in the care of social services until the court matter was dealt with. Moodley said that while the State acknowledged the public outcry following the crime, it was not likely the pair would try to evade their trial. Acting for the man, defence lawyer Andile Dakela read out an affidavit in which his client said he would plead not guilty, but did not disclose his defence. For the woman, defence attorney Mfanafuthi Biyela said she was a mother of four and a teacher. He also said the woman’s husband had offered to contribute towards bail. The identity of the baby’s father remains unknown as the man accused of taking her has claimed he is the child’s father. Paternity was not discussed in court on Wednesday. A number of people attended the court proceedings on Wednesday in support of the baby. The matter is back in court in May.
