A total of 492 units will be provided on the site where the fire broke out and another 423 housing units as part of a later phase on two other sites, according to mayco member for transport and urban development Brett Herron. A portion of the area that burnt is owned by SA National Parks, but “it is in the process of being transferred to the City”, said Herron. The fire victims have been told not to erect shacks on the fire site to allow the City to clear the debris, but some victims said the houses should be built speedily. Resident Ntsikelelo Siyo said: “The sooner they commence with their plans the better. We have to have roofs over our heads.” Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, who had a meeting with community leaders on Tuesday, said there was a concern over where people would be housed in the meantime. Sisulu said the finer details would be communicated in a public meeting she would attend on Wednesday “They (community leaders) are eager to get time frames.” Sisulu said the City had indicated it would allocate R30 million. She asked Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela to double the City’s amount, and her department would double that amount. Madikizela said registration of victims had started for temporary relocation.
