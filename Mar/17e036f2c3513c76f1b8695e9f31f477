He is currently still in hospital in Johannesburg. Kathrada, 87, was hospitalised on March 4 for surgery related to blood clotting on the brain. Recovery from his operation has, however, been slower than hoped for. Ahmed Kathrada Foundation director Neeshan Balton dispelled the rumour circulating that Kathrada had passed on. “We condemn the rumours and request the public to refrain from reposting or spreading fake news or any updates that cannot be verified. "We reiterate our commitment to providing regular and accurate updates about Mr Kathrada’s condition both to the media and the public.” He also thanked the public for the various initiatives that have been organised to wish Kathrada well. “We are deeply grateful for the immense support from the public. We are thankful for the various prayer meetings, vigils and messages of support that continue pouring in. "The support from both within South Africa and abroad are a reminder of how Kathrada has and continues to inspire so many.” He encouraged people to follow the foundation’s social media accounts where updates on Kathrada’s condition will be regularly posted. “Our Twitter handle is @KathradaFound. Updates posted via this account can be considered official.” Earlier this month, he said the veteran had experienced several health-related setbacks making the prognosis of his illness unpredictable.
