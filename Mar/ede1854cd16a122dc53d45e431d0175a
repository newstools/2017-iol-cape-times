The province is supplied with water by 44 dams, and  whose average storage level is currently at 30%. Level 3B restrictions are in place in the metro and the Drakenstein Municipality. In Beaufort West, level 3 water restrictions are in effect, as well as in the Swartland Municipality. In Cape Town there is about 113 days of water left. Acting president of the MJC, Shaykh Riad Fataar, said people of all ages heeded the call, and at the Panorama Mosque in Panorama this week, Muslims would repeat the same prayer. “Word of the prayer was spread among the Muslim community, and across mosques. "People of all ages and from all walks of life attended the prayer, and it was wonderful that we even had some Turks, Americans and 
Saudi Arabians attend,” Fataar said. The prayer took place in Chukker Road, Lansdowne, and lasted for about an hour and a half. As a prelude to the prayer, people were advised to consciously abstain from sin; increase in asking for forgiveness and taubah, or repentance; and fast for three days before the prayer. Earlier this month, mayor Patricia de Lille declared a local disaster in terms of section 55 of the Disaster Management Act, and on March 3 it was promulgated in the Provincial Gazette. This means the City may now invoke emergency procurement procedures if required to expedite the emergency and accelerated water resource schemes. The declaration is valid for a period of three months, but can be extended on a month-to-month basis by notice in the Gazette. https://www.facebook.com/CapeTimes/videos/1370024909721973/
