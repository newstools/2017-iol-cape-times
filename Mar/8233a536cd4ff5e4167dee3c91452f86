Carrying the Bible as we do cellphones would keep believers from falling into temptation, Pope Francis told Catholics gathered in St Peter s Square on Sunday. What would happen if we treated the Bible the way we treat our cellphone? What would happen if we read God s messages contained in the Bible the way we read messages on the mobile phone? the Argentine pontiff said.The paradoxical comparison was meant to show that if we had the word of God always in our hearts, no temptation could make us stray ,&nbsp;Francis explained on what is the first Sunday of Lent, a period of fasting and repentance leading up to Easter.The pope and members of the Roman Curia, or Vatican administration, are slated to begin a week-long Lenten retreat in the picturesque hill town of Ariccia near Rome later today. The retreat ends on Friday, the Vatican said.
