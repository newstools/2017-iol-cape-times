The funding of educational initiatives is a South African imperative to create a competitive workforce that contributes towards a vibrant economy, Adam Ebrahim, chief executive of Oasis, said yesterday. Twenty-nine students benefited from the Oasis bursary programme last year. Students also benefited by receiving mentoring, support and practical exposure to the corporate and social environments in which Oasis operates, allowing these students employment opportunities upon graduation. Oasis handed over a further R10 million to UCT yesterday, with Ebrahim stating: &quot;This investment will contribute to the alleviation of funding pressures through the allocation of bursary grants to students attending the university, and will also afford these students the same opportunities as the Oasis bursary recipients. The reality is that our educational system is under severe pressure, and unless a strengthened system is implemented, underpinned by a new social compact among all stakeholders, South Africa s challenges will continue to escalate.Ebrahim is passionate about business s contribution towards education. As individuals and citizens, as communities and as businesses, we need to contribute towards education, and we need to voice our concerns, but we also must work together to create solutions that will alleviate the pressures faced by students. &quot;Many may have access to education but become overwhelmed by the burden of debt as they leave tertiary institutions, which places graduates in a compromised position early on in their careers, he said.To date, Oasis has committed over R10m to early childhood development and close to R15m to secondary and tertiary-level education.
