The DA says the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has agreed to investigate the Eastern Cape Education Department for their failure to deliver top-up textbooks to more than 40 percent of schools in the province. On 21 February 2017, the DA wrote to the SAHRC to request an investigation into the Department of Education in the Eastern Cape, after a presentation to the portfolio committee on basic education revealed that an astounding 42 percent of top-up textbooks had not been delivered, DA spokesperson Nomsa Marchesi said.Marchesi said the SAHRC s decision to investigate the matter was based on a prima facie violation of a human right and it was a clear indication that the Eastern Cape s Education Department had breached the human rights of vulnerable young South Africans.Many of the affected schools, especially those in the townships, had experienced a backlog in textbooks and other educational resources for many years. It is unacceptable that young South Africans, who are desperate for a quality education and the opportunities that education provides, are subjected to such gross negligence by the ANC-led government, said Marchesi. It is of utmost importance that our children have the necessary tools to create better lives for themselves. Yet, the ANC-led government is failing yet another generation of young people. Marchesi said the SAHRC investigation would play an important role in holding the department accountable.Spokesperson for SAHRC Gail Smith confirmed receipt of complaint. The SAHRC confirms that it has received a complaint regarding the non-delivery of top up textbooks in the Eastern Cape and has opened a file on the matter. The education department was not immediately available for comment. African News Agency
