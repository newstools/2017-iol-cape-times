Upright Citizen is the début musical album released by  Marc Hendricks, and he is set to dazzle Cape Town audiences at the Artscape Theatre on April 22, for a one-night only performance. Proceeds will be donated to the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital for transformation initiatives. Hendricks, who has been writing and recording music since the early 1990s, says this CD has been “a long time coming” after his last release in 2000. “In late 2015 I asked my friend, Amanda Tiffin, to produce this recording which she accepted to my great excitement. “Amanda is one of those rare people who as a singer, composer, jazz vocal teacher, musical director and arranger can do it all and with consummate ease, so having her as my producer was a ‘no-brainer’,” he says. “After spending the first six months sifting through a what was then a large repertoire to decide which would make the eventual cut for the album, Amanda and I looked at older song-writing material as well as taking on new compositions, including a first collaboration on Do what You Say.” *  For more information visit www.marchendricks.co.za
