She's worn many kinds of dresses over the past 100 years: shift, A-line, maxi, and shirt dresses, to name but a few. But a flowing blue number that May Gomez wore to her 21st is one of her favourites. That was my favourite birthday. I had lots of family and we danced all night. Gomez, or Aunty May as she is affectionately known, celebrates her centenary today, and is the oldest resident in Kalk Bay.Her niece, Margaret Baker, lives with her, and secretly takes care of her loving aunt.But don t say that out loud Aunty May is still very independent and runs most of her errands herself. I m so proud of my aunt, and I m grateful that I am around to witness her 100th birthday.She's my mother s sister. I love her very much. Not everyone is privileged as I am to spend time with someone with so much life experience, Baker, 57, said.Aunty May is the eldest of 11 siblings. Her five remaining siblings are all over 80 years old.There is no secret to her longevity, she said yesterday, except thanking God every day. She is not on any medication, and does not suffer from any illness. I m just trying to be good by Him, Aunty May said.Gomez has lived through two world wars; the birth and demise of apartheid; and has outlived her husband Lawrence Gomez. Her memory fails her at times, but she always remembers important things, like birthdays.When the Cape Times visited yesterday, neighbours had already started wishing her a happy 100.Her family has organised a party for her tonight, and another big bash this weekend. I ve still got it, Aunty May said while doing a jig on her front stoep.
