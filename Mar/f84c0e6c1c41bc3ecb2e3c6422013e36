US inventories have climbed more than expected, causing prices to decline even as global producers cut their output, Kuwait’s Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq said, according to official news agency Kuna. Kuwait supports rolling over the oil cuts, though it was too early for the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on an extension, he said. “Kuwait supports the extension of the agreement after June,” Almarzooq said. An extension would "accelerate the rebalancing of the global oil market and contribute to the return of prices to levels acceptable for producing countries and for the petroleum industry in general”. Opec and 11 other major producers agreed last year to slash production, spurring a 20percent increase in Brent oil prices during the last five weeks of last year. The rally stalled this year as US output and supplies continued to grow. Brent crude, a global benchmark, has declined 9.6percent this year. Global inventories stand at 280 million barrels, built up over two years, and reducing them “within one or two months isn’t easy", Almarzooq said. “But I am certain and fully confident that the commitment of all the countries with this agreement will bear fruit in the next few months.” Iraq and Angola, two other Opec members, have signalled a willingness to back cuts beyond the first half of this year. Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih’s position on extending the cuts has shifted. Six weeks ago he said an extension was unnecessary; last week, he opened the door to the possibility of a rollover. Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak said he and other ministers discussed the possibility of an extension in their meetings last week. Compliance among Opec nations rose to 95percent last month from 91percent in January, Almarzooq said. -Bloomberg
