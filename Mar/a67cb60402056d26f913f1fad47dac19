Following a fruitful engagement between rivals Delft Taxi Associations and the Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (Cata) which ended on Thursday, the parties resumed discussions at the provincial regulatory entity (PRE) offices in Athlone on Friday, he said. They were joined by officials from the Transport and Public Works Department, the City of Cape Town and law enforcement authorities. Both engagements were facilitated by an independent group of mediators appointed by the department following the outbreak of violent conflict between taxi operators and drivers that left many commuters stranded, Grant said. The conflict also led to the killing of two taxi drivers, the blockade of key routes and the forceful closure of taxi ranks by the rival groups. The SAPS and traffic enforcement authorities responded swiftly with about 20 arrests and 40 vehicles impounded over the past week. “The engagements were able to broker a peace agreement between the rival parties. In the preamble to the agreement signed by the parties the taxi operators acknowledged the detrimental effects that the conflict had on the communities that they are meant to serve.” All groups committed to immediately resume peaceful operations and to resolve any future conflicts through peaceful dialogue. The taxi operators agreed to continue with further discussions to resolve a list of issues that were identified. - ANA
