But before that could happen Media24’s application to livestream the trial was heard. Judge Siraj Desai decided to grant permission for the livestream, with guidelines. Both the State and the Van Breda’s defence indicated that they would appeal against the ruling, which could be heard as early as next week by the Supreme Court of Appeals in Bloemfontein. Van Breda, 22, is facing three charges of murder, one of attempted murder as well as defeating the ends of justice. He allegedly killed his father Martin, his mother Teresa and his older brother Rudi with an axe. His younger sister Marli, who was 16 at the time of the incident, survived the attack but suffered brain damage and subsequent memory loss. Van Breda’s counsel Pieter Botha asked for a postponement soon after the court proceedings resumed after 2pm, stating that the defence team had to go through the State’s evidence. “We’ve received DNA reports in March this year. Among them, one of the reports deals with the murder weapon,” said Botha. The defence team had requested that the State provide them with original digital photographs of the crime scene, as opposed to the images which Botha claimed were from a PDF document, but the court was later told by senior State prosecutor Susan Galloway that these pictures were actually from a PowerPoint presentation. Botha said Van Breda was “champing at the bit” for the trial to start so that he could give the court his version of events. Desai granted a request for the trial to be postponed to April 24.
