Western Cape Premier Helen Zille says the majority of people who commit serious crime in the province are not white.This came out as Zille was responding to questions in the provincial legislature yesterday on the issue of the high rates of racism in the province since she took over as leader.ANC leader in the legislature Khaya Magaxa asked Zille to comment on his assertions that right-wing extremists, including high levels of racism, have intensified in the province .A clearly exasperated Zille first refused to respond, saying the rules of the house stipulated that she did not have to give a response to questions that required that she give an opinion.But minutes later, she hit back by saying: The ANC has been running a major campaign with a secretly funded war room to brand the Western Cape as racist because they can t stand the fact that we are running a better government.

As far as I am aware, the person who desecrated a mosque has not been identified, so I don t know why the honourable Magaxa is speculating about the race of that person. It could be anyone making an assumption about the race of that is completely outrageous, she said. If we are to do a racial breakdown in terms of assaults and murders in terms of victims and perpetrators, I think you will find that a majority of murders and assaults in this province are not perpetrated by white people. Magaxa went on to launch an attack on the DA, citing the recent resignations of members from senior positions as an indication of a sinking DA ship that could cost the party the Beaufort West municipality. Western Cape leader Patricia de Lille suddenly abandoned her position, causing shock waves for the DA, then the Western Cape legislature caucus leader (Ronald Lentit) went overboard and quit as a member of this institution. It is suspected as a motion of no confidence hours after the promotion of place holder, provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela, suppressing race undercurrents threatening to tip the DA boat, he said. In becoming (leader), Madikizela, on his first mission, could not salvage the DA in Beaufort West when mayor Djorge Malooi walked the plank to force a by-election in ward seven, where the DA might loose that municipality. But the DA has dismissed talks that the recent resignations are linked, saying Lentit and Malooi left to pursue other interests.DA spokesperson Anneke Scheepers said dates of a by-election to replace Malooi had yet to be announced. But with both the DA and ANC holding six seats in the council, whoever wins ward seven would have the majority.At last year s elections, the DA won the municipality after going into an alliance with the Karoo Democratic Force.
