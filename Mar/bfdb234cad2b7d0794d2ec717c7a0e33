Parliament Murder continues to pose a serious problem for the South African Police Service throughout the country, with the latest crime statistics released on Friday showing incidences of this crime dropping only marginally.The always eagerly awaited report on the state of crime in South Africa was released by members of the SAPS before Parliament s Portfolio Committee on policing on Friday morning.Murder, of course, always tops the list of interests and in this reporting period, like the last one, the story was grisly It spoke of more than 14 000 people dying violently at the hands of others. And although the figures show a drop 14 333 from April to December 2016, compared with 14 343 from April to December 2015 (a decrease of 0.1 percent, this is likely to provide scant comfort to those living in the heart of some of the country s most dangerous townships. Crime Research and Statistics Head, Major General Norman Sekhukhuni gave an overview of the crimes reported across police stations before breaking down the figures into province-sized chunks. He said the main contributors to the high murder rate were taxi violence, domestic violence, gang violence, and the lead up to the local government elections last year. Gang violence was found to be prominent especially in the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape, he said. He used Delft in the Western Cape as an example of ongoing problems with gang violence. He said 31 people had been killed in 31 days in one outbreak of violence involving gangs. Of 143 murders recorded, 103 were committed with a firearm, he said. The murder rate in Gauteng was up 3.7 percent, with 3 057 murders in first three quarters of the 2016/17 financial year, the highest number of murders in South Africa, while KwaZulu-Natal recorded a 1.7 percent increase, with 3 027 people killed. The Western Cape showed a 0.7 percent increase in murders, with 2 481 people killed, while Mpumalanga showed the biggest percentage increase in the country, of 6.8 percent, with 695 people killed.Of the other five provinces, the Northern Cape appears to be the safest place to live in terms of a low murder rate. It had a drop of 13.6 percent, just 248 murdered from April to December last year, compared with 287 recorded the previous year.Interestingly, the Eastern Cape, which like the Western Cape, also has a major gang problem, showed a small decrease in the number of murders 1.8 percent, or 2 831, compared with 2 882 the year before. With regard to sexual offences, the numbers remain high, but all bar one province recorded decreases in the number of offences registered. The province in which there was an increase was the Western Cape. Its figures went up from 5 343 to 5 361. The biggest drop was recorded by Limpopo 14.3 percent but Free State (12.1 percent) and Eastern Cape (10.9) also recorded improvements of above 10 percent. Gauteng, which with 7 516 had the highest number of cases in the last reporting period, showed a 2 percent improvement, with 7 362 cases this time. There were fewer rape cases reported from April to December 2016 in all the provinces, but figures are still high. By contrast, six of the provinces recorded an increase in the number of sexual assault cases, with Mpumalanga (11.9 percent) and Northern Cape (11 percent) leading the way, followed by Western Cape (8.9 percent). Robbery with aggravating circumstances continues to be a cause for concern, with only one province, Limpopo, recording a drop in the number of cases. Another concerning trend for the SAPS was a marked increase in the so-called trio crimes carjackings, robbery at businesses and in the homes of South Africans.Carjackings were up by 14.9 percent from April 1 to December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.Robberies at residential property was up 5.3 percent, while business robberies increased by 6.5 percent.A total of 6 429 cases of hijacking were lodged with the SAPS in Gauteng, a 16.3 percent increase. KwaZulu-Natal registered a 25.3 percent increase, with 2 358 carjackings. The Western Cape saw an 8.2 percent, with 1 730 carjackings between April and December last year.More people were robbed in their homes, 841 more than the previous three reporting quarters, an increase of 5.3 percent. The leading provinces in this regard were again Gauteng, with 6 590 cases (8.4 percent increase), followed by KwaZulu-Natal with 3 212 cases reported (1.5 percent increase), and the Western Cape with 1 994 (2.5 percent increase).While the Northern Cape had the least cases (114), it showed the biggest increase of 28.1 percent.Business robberies were up 6.5 percent, with Gauteng showing a 5.5 percent increase (5 537), followed by KwaZulu-Natal with 2 309 cases, revealing an 8.8 percent increase, and the Eastern Cape with 1 777 cases reported (7.6 percent).MPs expressed concern about the continuing increase in the trio crimes, with Police Minister Nathi Nhleko agreeing police needed to place a greater focus on preventing these crimes.&quot;Indeed, we should all of us be concerned about this,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to definitely zoom into this and deal with this problem.&quot;Political Bureau and African News Agency
