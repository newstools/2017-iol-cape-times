The more than 80 displaced shack dwellers of Bereaville near Genadendal, outside Greyton, were expected to spend their fourth night in a community hall as they await word on available land from the Theewaterskloof Municipality.On Sunday, violence erupted after shack dwellers and Bereaville residents argued over the construction of a shack on land that is part of a long-standing restitution claim.Several people were injured and the shack dwellers not allowed to return or retrieve their possessions.Business owner Geoff Cloete said one of his employees and his family were caught up in the violence, and he and many other residents had been assisting them since the conflict erupted. These people have almost lost all hope, unable to even bathe as they wait for the officials to help them. Land, even temporary land, would help these poor people reclaim their dignity, said Cloete.He said he and many of the greater Genadendal community were appalled by the violence and finally understood the restitution claim. But many, including the migrant workers, did not know of the circumstances. Cloete said further discussions were being held with mayor Christelle Vosloo, and there were discussions about land that could be used as a possible haven for the displaced community.Theewaterskloof Municipality spokesperson Hugo Geldenhuys confirmed that the mayor had been meeting the affected communities, including the displaced shack dwellers. They are considering venues where the people can be temporarily housed. Once a decision has been taken, the municipality will provide water and mobile sanitation facilities to the families, said Geldenhuys.He said discussions were continuing and no agreement had been confirmed as yet.
