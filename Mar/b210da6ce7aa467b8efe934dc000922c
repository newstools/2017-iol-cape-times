An art auction at the V&A Waterfront on Monday smashed records as a number of works achieved multiples of pre-auction estimates, Aspire Art Auctions said on Tuesday. The company said its inaugural Cape Town sale had attracted widespread interest from the media and collectors, with “fervent bidding from across the world”. Aspire says it is bringing a new vision to the market with a “curated approach, with fewer lots offered and a greater focus on quality”. At estimates of R2,5m-R3,5m, JH Pierneef’s A view across Fisherman’s Cove, Seychelles, sold for R4,547,200, more than four times the previous record for a non-South African subject by the artist. Vrystaat Reën, also Pierneef, achieved R2,046,240, also beating the estimate of R500,000 by four times. Hugo Naude’s Kammanassie River, Oudtshoorn, which was repatriated from Germany for this auction, fetched R704,816. Emma Bedford, head of Aspire’s Cape Town office, said the auction proved that the company’s vision of developing the market was “not only achievable but enthusiastically supported by collectors hungry for exciting new developments in the industry”. The company said “Amadlozi artists” fared well at the auction too. Amadlozi, or ancestors, refers to this group’s conscious appropriation of African artistic traditions. Of this group, Edoardo Villa’s Vertical Composition set a new record at R1,818,880. And, Aspire added, the market for work by Cecil Skotnes was affirmed with Ravine Wall selling for R795,760. Gerard Bhengu’s Veld fire achieved R181,888, six times the estimate. Louis Maqhubela’s Exiled King sold for R341,040, more than tripling his previous record, and representing “long-awaited and well-received recognition of this significant artist”, Aspire said. Contemporary artwork also fared well, with David Brown’s Hanging Man selling for R227,360, three times his previous record, and Steven Cohen’s Chandelier going for R176,204, seven times his previous record. Mohau Modisakeng, who will be representing South Africa at the Venice Biennale 2017, achieved R204,624 for his work Ditaola XV. Moshekwa Langa doubled his previous record with his mixed media composition, she thought of him often, selling for R102,312, while Brett Murray’s work Corporate Identity achieved R68,208. – African News Agency (ANA)
