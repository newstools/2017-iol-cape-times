The 87-year-old is revered for establishing his own publishing and art galleries during the apartheid era, and these days tends to his “Zen garden” at his home in Athlone. Matthews lives with his 34-year-old nephew, and said his municipal bill was “outrageous”. “Our bill has never exceeded more than a few hundred rand, and there must be some type of screw-up by the city’s officials. I am a pensioner and receive a government grant; I would be paying this account to my grave,” said Matthews. He said his garden, which contains predominantly indigenous plants and succulents, was only watered in the mornings and he used a watering can. “A city official came and investigated, and he has taken my statements and checked our water meter.   "I have spoken to the mayor (Patricia de Lille), and because of our relationship she has seen to it that her officials attend to the matter. Her promise is that this city works for you,” said Matthews. Neighbour Thomas Hartnick said that work was done by city officials last year to repair the water meters on his and Matthews's property. “I have the same type of meter which only provides an amount of 350 litres per day, and our rates account has remained relatively the same. Perhaps the meter is faulty or there is a leak as it shows over 9 000 litres used, and there is absolutely no way James could possibly use that much,” said Hartnick. Mayor Patricia de Lille’s spokesperson, Zara Nicholson, confirmed the mayor had been made aware of the situation after a call from Matthews on Wednesday night. “As soon as she became aware of his situation the mayor assured him that the matter would be resolved. "A representative from the mayor’s office visited his home this morning (yesterday),” said Nicholson. She said the mayor’s office was investigating and the matter would be resolved as soon as possible.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
