According to the protesters, ANC Ward 40 councillor Bongani Ngcombolo promised them jobs before he was elected in August. Yesterday a group of 50 protesters filed into the Luyolo community hall in Gugulethu where Ngcombolo was meeting with the community. But he was heckled during the meeting, and stood quietly as  community members voiced their  anger. Community members said he had promised to clean up Gugulethu, to provide better toilets, improve housing and give jobs to people who were chosen from the “first” database list that had been provided by the local ANC branch. When the group entered the hall, Ngcombolo was ushered out by a seven-man squad of  armed law enforcement 
officers. One protester, who would only give his name as Zukisa, said: “What we have here is a corrupt councillor, Bongani Ngcombolo, who has given jobs to people he likes and not those who were meant to be selected from the database. “So the people are crying and shouting about the unprincipled actions that this councillor is performing. “This councillor promised to provide proper housing, proper toilets and to clean up the streets of Gugulethu,” Zukisa said Ngcombolo said: “These problems that you see in Gugulethu are ones that have always been around. These are problems that were there before you and me. “I know that I said I would fix things, but that doesn’t mean that it’s going to be instantaneous. These things take time.” The meeting ended with the angry community members throwing newspapers and garbage bags at him.
