Struggle veteran Ahmed Kathrada, 87, is in a stable condition after an operation in a Johannesburg hospital to remove a blood clot on the brain, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation said on Sunday.&quot;Kathrada was admitted to the hospital on Saturday for surgery related to blood clotting on the brain, foundation director Neeshan Balton said.Kathrada was initially admitted for dehydration, but doctors later picked up the clot, which had subsequently been removed. Kathrada, despite being ill prior to the operation, was in good spirits. Doctors last night (Saturday) indicated that the operation was successful and he is in a stable condition. However, it would be some time before Kathrada fully recovers, Balton said.Due to hospital regulations and the necessity for a relaxed period of recovery only visits from immediate family would be permitted. We do, however, wish to thank the public as well as Kathrada s many friends and comrades for their well-wishes and support. We hope that you continue remembering him in your prayers and take time to reflect on the ideals and values that Kathrada and his generation stood for, Balton said.Kathrada is one of three Rivonia Trialists still alive today the other two being Andrew Mlangeni and Denis Goldberg. Along with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, Raymond Mhlaba, and Elias Motsoaledi, they were sentenced in 1964 to life imprisonment on Robben Island during the famous Rivonia Trial.
