Her capping took place yesterday during the Cape Peninsula University of Technology  Education Faculty graduation ceremony and cheering her on from the front row was a very special guest, Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu. Le Roux is the chief executive of the Artscape Theatre Centre and the first woman and black person to fill this role since the centre's inception in 1971. She was honoured for her contribution to the performing arts, education and social transformation. Le Roux told the excited graduates she was pleased to be honoured by CPUT because the education offered at the university was relevant and important. “I stand here today to receive this honour from a university that focuses on vocational skills and technical training, innovative problem-solving and career- directed courses with communities as end users, the kind of graduates sorely needed in our country. The doers, the engineers, the artisans, the teachers produced right here.” Le Roux dedicated her honour to all persons living with disabilities, especially young rural girls. “I count myself fortunate enough to be one of the few with a disability who is gainfully employed. Your attitude in life will determine how people will perceive you. "Share with others your wealth and life will become simple and manageable.” Then speaking to Tutu, she thanked him for his presence. “Tata Arch you made my day. You are our spiritual leader who keeps the world accountable.”
