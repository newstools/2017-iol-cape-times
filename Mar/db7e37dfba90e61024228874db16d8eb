The residents said that they had nowhere to sleep, and sleeping at the designated tents was not an option because their belongings might be stolen, hence they decided to rebuild their shacks on the site. The residents said their main concern was opportunistic people from surrounding areas who live in brick houses and who were benefiting from the tons of relief donated by generous donors. But the city says all systems are in place and it had restored water and electricity services, and solid waste and cleaning staff remain on site. Acting mayor Ian Neilson said standpipes and temporary floodlights were in the process of being installed. Neilson said the provision of building material and re-blocking of the informal settlement, which would be completed early next week, was expected to cost close to R100 million. He said most of the affected fire victims “have opted to stay with friends or relatives” instead of utilising the three halls and two marquee tents erected specially for them. Neilson said an environmental health practitioner was on site daily to inspect ablutions and water provision. Nosiphiwo Dondolo said she had been sleeping on rocks on the mountain because she was safeguarding her belongings. “The rightful beneficiaries are not receiving aid, it seems it is free for all, including people with brick houses not affected by the fire. There are opportunists taking what is not intended for them,” said Dondolo. She said she started rebuilding on Tuesday after seeing that the city’s re-blocking was taking time. Mayco member for safety and security and social services JP Smith acknowledged there were a “fair amount of opportunistic people taking advantage”, adding that law enforcement was not at the site to stop the residents from rebuilding.
