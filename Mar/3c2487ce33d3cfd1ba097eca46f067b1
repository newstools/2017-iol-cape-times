A final opportunity to be officially verified as an Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) veteran is being extended to anti-apartheid activists who claim they were members of the ANC wing.The MKMVA (Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association) Dullah Omar Region is making the last call to military veterans, who are not yet on the database of the Department of Military Veterans, to attend the registration and verification process on Saturday.The process, to take place at the Castle of Good Hope from 8am, will be the last and final verification one, said MKMVA Dullah Omar Region chairperson Fumanekile Booi. The confirmation of membership and registration on the Department of Military Veterans database is essential for those who want to apply for a military veterans' pension, access to health care, education and housing,&quot; said Booi. We, as MK, are making the final verification of our people after many verifications have been done. &quot;The (verification) process was closed last year, but we asked for it to be reopened to accommodate our members who are not yet verified. So, we are calling on all MK members who are not yet verified to come and apply (for MK veteran status).&quot;He said MK figures such as Tony Yengeni, Bongani Jonas, Lynne Brown, Chris Nissen and Mcebisi Skwatsha will form part of the verification panel.Booi said applications for verification and registration could be done only in person and not through a representative. He added that people who will assist with the verification process will come from other anti-apartheid formations such as the UDF, the Albert Luthuli Detachment, the Ashley Kriel Detachment and youth structures from the Struggle.
