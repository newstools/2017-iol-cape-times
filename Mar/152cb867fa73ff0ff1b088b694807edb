Three people, including a 69-year-old woman, were hospitalised at Tygerberg hospital for burn wounds. The pensioner was discharged from hospital on Sunday. David Charles, 44, whose home was burnt to the ground, said the fire started at the wendyhouse he shares with his girlfriend and their baby. Charles said he was going to a shop just before 10pm on Saturday and when he returned their home was on fire. He said that his epileptic girlfriend had a seizure, collapsed and overturned a candle. “The flames were too high and spread very quickly to other houses. We could do nothing except to watch our homes being destroyed by the fire. We were helpless,” said Charles. Fire and Rescue Services spokesperson Tracey Whittaker said firefighters responded to the fire with two fire engines, a water tanker and a rescue vehicle. She said 33 people were left homeless and one woman sustained burn wounds to her leg and was taken to hospital. Whittaker said Charles suffered smoke inhalation but declined to go to hospital. Charles said he lost all his belongings in the fire and has been sleeping with family members since Saturday night. “It is better that no one died. We pray for a speedy recovery for those in hospital. We lost everything. We need assistance of any kind to restart our lives because no one is working,” he said. Ward councillor Angus McKenzie said the families would be assisted with building materials and were housed at a community hall since Saturday night. Police spokesperson Frederick van Wyk confirmed the fire, but no case was opened with the police.  sandiso.phaliso@inl.co.za
