Winds of up to 58km/*  prompted organisers to cancel the last two shows which were being held inside a marquee at Camps Bay. This followed the advice of engineering, health and safety experts. Organisers, African Fashion International (AFI), spokesperson Nadya du Plessis said despite the unfortunate turn of events there had been great support from within the fashion industry. “People showed their support and stood in solidarity with the executive decision to put the safety of the people first,” said du Plessis. She said everyone is looking forward to the rescheduled event. She said the opening show by Gavin Rajah was well-received by the audience followed by David Tlale’s exciting off-site installation. AFI executive chairperson Precious Moloi-Motsepe held a press conference on Saturday regarding the rescheduling. “There was a wonderful turnout as people showed their support and solidarity for the unfortunate postponement of the highly anticipated shows. "It will be joined by representatives from Mercedes-Benz South Africa, Chattels (AFI’s appointed tent supplier), health and safety supervisor, show producers and our local and Pan-African designers,” said Motsepe. She said the organisers, show producers and suppliers would ensure the utmost effort would be made to accommodate local and Pan-African designers on the revised dates. The Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Cape Town 2017 will now be held from April 6-8. Anyone with further queries or concerns can contact the organisers on 0113241500.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
