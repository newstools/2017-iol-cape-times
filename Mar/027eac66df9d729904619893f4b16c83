A journalist from Kokstad in KwaZulu-Natal is in hot water over an alleged racist Facebook post stating that South Africa belonged only to black people. The full Facebook status update which was posted yesterday morning read: “Let me remind you that South Africa belongs to Black People, and all other racial groups are nothing but aliens.”  Additional comments allegedly made by Andile Moshoeshoe refer to his stance that certain people should be “(necklaced) as they did to our freedom fighters”. Social activist Yusuf Abramjee reported the incident to the journalist's supposed employer. Moshoeshoe’s Facebook profile cited that he worked as a senior political correspondent at Gagasi FM, a commercial radio station in KwaZulu-Natal. However, in a tweet, the radio station disputed the claims and said Moshoeshoe did not have any full-time position at the station. “He doesn’t hold any full-time position within the station, therefore claims that he’s a Senior Political Reporter at #GagasiFM are untrue and misleading. In fact there is no such position within the station,” the station tweeted. “We would like to distance the name of the station from any statement that Moshoeshoe makes in his personal capacity.” Moshoeshoe has since apologised for his comments in a subsequent Facebook update.
