Chadwin Johnson, 17, and Tasreeq Martin, 13, of the Twelve Shooters Pool Club in Retreat, were selected for the world event as part of a nine-player Western Province Pool Union team at the National Championships of Pool Billiard South Africa last October. “Chadwin was crowned champion in the under 18 category, and Tasreeq took sixth place in the under 18 category (of the national championships) in Secunda, Mpumalanga,” said Chadwin's father and Twelve Shooters Pool Club chairperson Donovan Johnson. Explaining that it would cost the two boys about R80 000 – which they and the club don’t have – to travel and participate in the world championships, Johnson said they were going all-out to raise the money. “They will need money for their visas and passports, air tickets, tournament fees, special clothes for playing, accommodation, money for food and some spending money,” he said. Their club will start their fund-raising with a dance, music and song extravaganza that 
includes a three-course meal on Saturday, March 25 at the Delta Primary School in Peter Charles Street, Retreat, with tickets costing R150 a person or R1 500 a table. Johnson said their club had lots of problems with finances, and “last year, when we went to Secunda, one of our players from Lavender Hill had to withdraw due to a lack of funds. “We make a contribution in keeping the youth away from violent crime, gangsterism, drug abuse, teenage pregnancies and many other social ills that are so prevalent in this community.” He said Chadwin started playing when he was seven years old and Tasreeq when he was eight. Twelve Shooters Pool Club, which Johnson founded at his home in 12th Avenue, Retreat, is affiliated to the Western Province Pool Union, which is affiliated to Pool Billiard SA.
