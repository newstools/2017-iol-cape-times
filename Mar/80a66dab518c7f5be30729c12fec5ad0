The Basic Education Minister on Monday strongly condemned the murder of a KwaZulu-Natal teacher who was shot dead in front of her class on Saturday. Priscilla Mchunu, 54, was gunned down by two men while teaching Saturday classes to a group of matric pupils in the city of Pietermaritzburg. “This is an absolutely barbaric act which has shocked all of us in the education sector. The brutal murder of one of our dedicated educators in front of school children is completely inhumane. All of these learners will have to go for counselling after what they have witnessed,” Motshekga said in a statement “My thoughts and prayers are with the family of Ms Mchunu at this time and with all of those at Laduma High School who have lost one of their own in such a traumatic manner.” Motshekga said while the motive for the murder remained unclear, she had urged police to track down the “extremely dangerous criminals who need to be removed from society as a matter of urgency”. – African News Agency (ANA)
