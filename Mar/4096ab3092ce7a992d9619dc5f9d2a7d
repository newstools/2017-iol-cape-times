Van Greunen’s gigantic pumpkin beat last year’s winner which hit the scales at 506kg. The Giant Pumpkin Festival held  at the Hessequa Municipality, Heidelberg, had 65 participants competing for the biggest pumpkin on show. The festival has been taking place for the past six years and competition organisers said the seeds used in growing the pumpkins had not been genetically modified, and were in fact from Canada. Additional prizes were awarded for pumpkins and placed into different categories from the smallest, prettiest and ugliest. Jaco Uys’s 387.5kg pumpkin won him the second prize. Alongside the giant pumpkin 
competition, the festival also included a mountain bike race, 35km trail run. Pumpkin carvings were created; there was a pumpkin throwing competition and a 1.2m x 2.2m massive pumpkin pie was produced. All proceeds from the festival were given to the town to assist local schools and an old age home.
