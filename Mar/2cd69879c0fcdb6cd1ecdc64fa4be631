DA leader Mmusi Maimane called for South Africans to stand together and defend the constitutional democracy of the country after President Jacob Zuma axed Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebesi Jonas. “The president has once again shown that he has no interest in our beloved country’s future – or the nine million South Africans who are unemployed. He has bowed to the whims of those who are determined to enrich themselves at the expense of the poor and jobless. This is an act of complete state capture,” Maimane said in a statement. “We cannot sit by and let this happen. It is time that all South Africans stand together to protect our democracy. It is Parliament who hired Jacob Zuma and it is Parliament that can fire him. We therefore urge all political parties, including members of the ANC, to vote President Jacob Zuma out when the DA’s motion of no confidence is debated in the National Assembly.” Maimane said that it was time for South Africans to stand together and defend what “so many fought and died” for. Late on Thursday night, Zuma announced Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba as the new finance minister and Sifiso Buthelezi as his deputy in a midnight cabinet reshuffle that affected over 10 portfolios.
