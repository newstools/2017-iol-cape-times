Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: “The management of the SAPS in the Western Cape has through regular crime analysis noted with concern an upsurge in gang-related incidents in some parts of Cape Flats lately. "As a response, a team led by a number of  provincial brigadiers were devolved to identified station areas, as a means of quelling these incidents.” Shooting incidents in Elsies River left one man dead and two others injured at the weekend. “According to reports, the victims, two males and a female, were walking towards Spoenspruit Court in Epping Forest when three suspects approached them from the park side and started shooting. The suspects then ran away.” The motive and circumstances surrounding this incident is being investigated. “Various operations are conducted on a weekly basis in the Elsies River policing area where premises are searched for illegal firearms and other substances,” Van Wyk added. CPF spokesperson Imraahn Mukaddam said shootings have moved from the Leonsdale area to The Range and Epping Forest. “It is a turf war raging on between two rival gangs and they are using specialised weaponry. It sounds almost like automatic rifles being used and other gunfire sounds almost explosive. “We do suspect the flare-up since last week can be attributed to the shooting outside the Belliville Magistrate’s Court last week where gangsters shot at each other and fled the scene.”  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
