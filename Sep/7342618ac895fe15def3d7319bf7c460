Cape Town - Two Mitchells Plain mothers are angry after their sons, one of them disabled, were brutally assaulted, allegedly while in police custody. One of the young men had to be hospitalised after nearly losing his eye in the attack. Fatiema Maart, 54, claims her son Roman Maart, 23, was beaten to a pulp by Lentegeur SAPS officers. She says he received “daily beatings” since last Wednesday when he was arrested. Roman and Naziem Hendricks, 29, were only released on Sunday. The mothers say to make matters worse, police at Lentegeur SAPS refused to lay charges against their colleagues. Naziem’s mother, Jubeiga Hendricks, 64, says her disabled son was beaten with his own crutches. Nazeem has a deformed spine. “They hit my son with his own crutches. He suffers from spinal problems. We spoke to the captain and the colonel, but those people are so rude,” she says. “I had enough of the police’s brutality and verbal abuse. Enough is enough.” They say the drama started last Wednesday when cops arrived to break up a gang fight in Waterval Road, Tafelsig. Fatiema explains: “Last week the Fancy Boys came to shoot here on the Junior Mafias. When they came here, police shouted to everyone, including children: ‘Lê plat julle * ***ers’. (Lay flat, you f***ers) “People got angry because police were showing their anger towards the wrong people, not the gangsters. “They started arguing with them and rubber bullets were then shot. “They took my son and his friend. They were beaten. We couldn’t even go visit them at the police station. “I didn’t even know my child was in hospital lying under three drips. That’s how he was beaten. Sy oog was amper uit (His eye was almost taken Out). They messed him up. “I wanted to lay charges against those officers, but police did not want to take our case. “At the police station one officer told us: ‘Ons is f***** met julle te doen nie, julle kan vrek gaan’ (We have f*** all to do with you, you can die),” an angry Fatiema says. Police spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel André Traut, says the allegations against SAPS members are serious and advised the mothers to see the police station management. “Serious allegations are made against SAPS, which will require an investigation. Kindly encourage the person who made these allegations to approach the management of Lentegeur Police Station, or any other police station to report the alleged assault. “Alternatively, the complainant can report the matter to Ipid for an investigation,” Traut said.
