Another man, Leroy Morrison has been charged as an accessory to murder. Linda Ntulo, 26, is in custody 
on charges of attempting to murder Jam-
Jam’s stepfather Mike Mguga and damaging his property earlier this year. In this case, his lawyer David Mbazwana, told Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court magistrate Vernon Jantjies, also on Friday, that his client would apply for bail. The attempted murder case will be combined with Jam-Jam’s murder, but Mbazwana is disputing this, because the attempted murder of Jam-Jam’s stepfather was reported in March and Jam-Jam’s murder happened recently. “It can’t be connected,” he told Jantjies. “When did the State know the accused would be charged? Where is that centralisation going to take place? “We don’t want a situation where the case (attempted murder) is going to be remanded because of the centralisation of this matter. “We don’t know what is the status of the Athlone case. This matter is not related to the Athlone case,” said Mbazwana. He said it was concerning that he only received information about the centralisation of the cases a few hours before court proceedings. “We request the State to  give us a clear indication of what is happening.” Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed Ntulo’s 
arrest. Ntulo will appear in the 
Athlone Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. “Protecting vulnerable groups remains a top priority of the SAPS,” said Rwexana.
