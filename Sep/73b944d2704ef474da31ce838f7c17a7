Airbnb listings in Khayelitsha are on the rise, according to the provincial Economic Opportunities, Tourism, Economic Development and Agriculture Department. Yesterday Khayelitsha-based tourism entrepreneurs highlighted their offering as part of Tourism Month. Bronwynne Jooste, spokesperson for Agriculture, Economic  Development and Tourism  MEC Alan Winde, said Airbnb listings in Khayelitsha were on the rise, with six homes currently listed and many wanting to rent these homes. “Interest is growing to the point that Airbnb now has an office at the Barn in Khayelitsha to advise aspiring entrepreneurs,” said Jooste. The Barn, situated in Look-Out-Hill in Khayelitsha, is a space created for entrepreneurs to use the internet, look for opportunities and utilise all the tools at their disposal to grow their businesses and ideas. The Barn has been a space for innovation and operation for the six Khayelitsha Bed-and-Breakfasts. The hosts are sharing South Africa's culture with the world, said Jooste. Yesterday, some Bed-and-Breakfast owners said Airbnb has allowed township businesses to form real connections with both local and international customers. Majoro’s Bed-and-Breakfast owner Maria Maile said: “We have been hosting travellers from various parts of the world in our home and it is exciting to interact with diverse people of different cultures. "To be able to sustain a tourism business in the townships one must have a backbone and, with patience, one will be able to see the results in the future,” said Maile.
