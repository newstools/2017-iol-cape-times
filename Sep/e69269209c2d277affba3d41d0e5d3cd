The world-famous Jam Session was originally held on a Monday night but has shifted to Sundays. Experience nostalgia every Sunday from 8pm with veteran Cape Town Band Out Of Town and some of the hottest up-and-coming talent on the Cape Town live performance scene. The house band features the likes of music director Camillo Lombard on keyboards, Tich Jean-Pierre on guitar and lead vocals, Lionel Beukes on double bass and vocal, and Denver “The Fiery” Furness on drums. They back all performers who come up to jam.  The stage is open to any genre, and to individuals or groups, wanting to showcase their talent. Wine and dine the night away with a full bar and tasty food, from curries, to burgers and pizzas with addictive “swing chilli source”. Our “Swingers Gives Back” (SGB) initiative is an effort to support youth development in the Western Cape. The SGB has partnered with a local NPO (www.lavsa.co.za) that facilitates youth development programs through skills training linked to employment. The SGB is currently campaigning to acquire laptops for the Lav SA NPO  mobile youth training activities aimed at youth in Cape Town. Book on 021 761 8799 or 079 516 0998.
