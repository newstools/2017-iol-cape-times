The murders on Tuesday rocked the already gang-plagued community of Hanover Park. The victims were shot and killed in two different incidents. One was a foreign-national shop owner. Police spokesperson Sinathi Joni said: “A 40-year-old man (was) fatally wounded during a shooting incident that took place at Ryston Road, Hanover Park in Philippi.” A murder case is being investigated and no arrests have yet been made. The other victim was shot on the same day, said another police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana. “On (Tuesday) in Surwood Walk, Hanover Park a 45-year-old man was shot and fatally wounded by an unknown suspect. Circumstances surrounding this incident are under investigation,” she said. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: “As a response, a team led by a number of provincial brigadiers were devolved to identified station areas, as a means of quelling these incidents.” Van Wyk said the team of brigadiers was supported by Public Order police members, detection teams, the Tactical Response Team and stabilisation unit members as well as intelligence operatives to bolster capacity at cluster and station levels. Van Wyk said the interventions were set to continue until the situation had stabilised. “An appeal is made to communities to work with members deployed in these areas to ensure safety for all.”
