Cape Town - Wedding bells will soon be ringing for our world champion Wayde van Niekerk, and it will definitely be before the end of the year. The Olympic gold medallist has confirmed that he and his fiancé Chesney Campbell, 24, will be tying the knot later this year. Wayde, 25, who was born and bred in Kraaifontein, went down on bended knee last December, proposing to his girlfriend of nearly four years. He informed his fans with a short video on Instagram with a caption which read, “she said yes”, showing off the rock on Chesney’s finger.  ☝ A post shared by Wayde van Niekerk (@waydedreamer) on Dec 29, 2016 at 9:04am PST  Wayde told The Citizen newspaper this week that he has been focusing on preparing for his wedding, which is happening towards the end of the year. Though he wouldn’t share any more details, he said he was very excited about marrying the love of his life. Campbell, who lectures at the Free State University, also seemed to confirm their upcoming nuptials. Last month, Campbell tweeted: “My body is so sore after yesterday’s gym. But we want to look good in wedding dresses and life in general. So we go again. (sic).”    The two lovebirds have been seen at multiple events, strutting on the red carpet.
