South Africa is not represented at the ongoing Unicef early childhood development workshop in Maputo, Mozambique, even though the economic powerhouse was invited and several reminders sent to relevant officials. Pablo Stansbery, the Unicef regional adviser on Early Childhood Learning (ECD), said on Tuesday he had no idea why South Africa, which already has pre-primary education known as "Grade R", was not attending the five-day workshop. South Africa was invited in good time and at least three reminders were sent to enquire if any delegates would participate in the workshop. About 100 delegates from other African countries are in Maputo seeking ways to cost, fund, expand and improve pre-primary education. Delegates from Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia are taking part in the workshop. Millions of children in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to pre-primary education. The host nation, Mozambique, has a population of about 26 million people, with 4.5 million children under the age of five. Only 4four percent of these children have access to ECD services. Unicef, which provides humanitarian and developmental assistance to children and mothers in developing countries, has research data that shows the benefits of early childhood learning to the individual and the country that invests in such education. Wycliffe Otieno, the chief of Education and Adolescent Development at Unicef in South Africa, did not immediately respond to queries about the no-show. African News Agency
