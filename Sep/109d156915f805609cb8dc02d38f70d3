Metrorail management should be behind bars for its dismal failure to transport workers safely to and from work, Cosatu Western Cape secretary Tony Ehrenreich said on Wednesday. "We want the bosses of Metrorail to go to jail for endangering our lives," Ehrenreich said while handing over a memorandum of demands to Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker. Ehrenreich, who is leading a march of several hundred workers, said Cosatu had last week laid a charge of reckless endangerment with the police against Metrorail management.

Ehrenreich said Cosatu was demanding at least three security guards on every carriage, while it also wants Metrorail to slash their prices in half to compensate workers who often have to pay for alternative transport when trains don't arrive on time or are too full to board. The march to Metrorail formed part of a wider countrywide protest against corruption and state capture. The marches have been organised by the Cosatu, along with the SA Communist Party. In Cape Town, workers, most of them dressed in red, first made their way to the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) to hand over a memorandum airing their displeasure with the ineffective Metrorail train service in Cape Town. Among those marching was former deputy general secretary of the SACP Jeremy Cronin. The workers, some holding up posters reading “Zuma must go”, were then set to make their way to the provincial legislature and Parliament. African News Agency
