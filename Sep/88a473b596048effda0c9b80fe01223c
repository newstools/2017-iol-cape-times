The event is a chance for local fashion designers and models to make a name for themselves, said co-founder Bongani Matenjwa. He and his three partners believe young people from disadvantaged communities must create their own opportunities. “I work at a local radio station and myself and my fellow founders and organisers saw there was a need to create this space for young designers to show their talent. "This is funded purely by ourselves, for ourselves and we want to promote not just the talent here, but bring together our people and celebrate our community,” said Matenjwa. Co-ordinator Asanda Veco said it was also a way to introduce outsiders to Khayelitsha and welcome designers from other areas.
