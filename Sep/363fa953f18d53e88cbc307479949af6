Cape Town -  “We are here for the Madam,” Cosatu announced as thousands of its supporters arrived at the doors to the Western Cape Provincial Legislature in Wale Street, Cape Town on Wednesday. There was a heavy police presence on the steps to the legislature, and Cosatu had initially vowed to break through the police barricade to deliver its memorandum to Western Cape premier Helen Zille, demanding her resignation. "The first thing that we must remember about this madam is that she does not take the interest of the people into consideration," Cosatu provincial secretary Tony Ehrenreich said. Ehrenreich also lambasted the Premier for her alleged relationship with the Guptas, saying she had accepted party funding from the controversial family.    “Zille must go and she must go now.” Zille was not available to accept the memorandum in person. "We will not going to accept the puppets Zille sends to accept the memorandum," Ehrenreich said. Cosatu then chose to slide the memorandum under the door of the old entrance to the provincial legislature. marvin.charles@inl.co.za @marvincharles17 Cape Argus
