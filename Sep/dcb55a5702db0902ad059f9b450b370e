Johannesburg - President Jacob Zuma's question and answer session in Parliament was once again a dramatic affair as Zuma came under attack from opposition parties, particularly EFF MPs. Zuma appeared in the National Assembly to answer questions on Thursday, but the session soon descended into chaos when EFF leader Julius Malema attacked the president. Malema began his taunts by repeatedly calling Zuma uBaba ka Duduzane (Duduzane's father). National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete then tried to silence him, causing Malema to fire back and say that she should get used to the fact that the opposition had a right to be heard in the National Assembly. He accused her of abusing her power. In one dramatic moment, Malema and the president had a heated argument, with Zuma finally losing his temper after the EFF leader interrupted him while giving his response to a question posed by Malema. The heated exchange has since done the rounds on social media, eliciting hilarious responses. Watch the video below:    IOL
