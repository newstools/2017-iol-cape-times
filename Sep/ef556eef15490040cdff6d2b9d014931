The De Doorns mother of a five-year-old boy and 11-month-old girl was allegedly killed by her boyfriend in a jealous rage at the weekend. They reportedly had an argument at the home of her mother Katrina Ryk on the Vergenoegd Farm. Her children have been placed in the care of her family. Commenting on the amount of support they have received since his cousin's death, family spokesperson Joseph Ryk said: “We don't have words to explain how we feel after the support by the people in our town and even from people outside of it. "Laurina’s mother, Katrina, her sisters and her boy are still too raw with emotion, finding it difficult to face people they don't know.” He said the funeral would be held next weekend and more memorial services would be held over the next week. Women on Farms manager Rebecca Mort said they had visited the De Doorns region but were unable to meet the family yesterday as they were still too distraught and emotional. The organisation's members in De Doorns would support the Ryk family during this period. Laurina’s murder has been condemned by the Commission for Gender Equality, who called it a stark reminder that South Africa wasn't addressing gender-based violence effectively. The commission said they would be monitoring the case to ensure the accused and the victims received a fair trial. Provincial social development department spokesperson Sihle Ngobese said social workers would be providing ongoing trauma counselling and child protection services. The department called for a thorough investigation and for officials to prepare a strong case, said Ngobese. National Prosecuting Agency spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the accused would appear in court next month and remain in custody.
