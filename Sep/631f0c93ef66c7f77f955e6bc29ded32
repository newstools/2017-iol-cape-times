The condition is that tariffs will be renegotiated to under 77 cents a KWh. Energy Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi recently announced that Eskom would in October sign PPAs with renewable energy producers, after major delays which the renewable industry said created uncertainty in the fast-growing sector. Sawea said while the announcement had provided policy certainty, it was concerned about the condition, which went against rules in the Renewable Energy Procurement Programme. “This condition, which requires tariff negotiating, is illegal in the Renewable Energy Procurement Programme’s rules. Sawea is looking to the minister for guidance as to how this condition will be imposed,” the association said. Kubayi said her department, through independent power producers, will re-negotiate to not-above 77c a kilowatt hour. “This will greatly assist in reducing the requirements for additional government guarantees that would impact negatively in the current economic climate and constraints in the fiscus,” Kubayi said. The condition aside, Sawea chief executive Brenda Martin said Kubayi’s announcement was evidence that the country’s Renewable Energy Procurement Programme remained part of the government’s vision for South Africa’s development in the transition towards a more diverse energy mix. “The thousands of South Africans employed by the renewable energy industry, the many rural communities surrounding current and prospective wind farms who have been waiting for the development benefits associated with renewable power investment, are without doubt heartened by the confirmation that preferred bids from rounds 3.5 and 4 will be concluded within two months,” Martin said. The South Africa Photovoltaic Industry Association has also welcomed the announcement, saying it will bring investment, secure jobs, and create new jobs and opportunities for communities surrounding projects.
