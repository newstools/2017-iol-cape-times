Consul-general of Brazil in Cape Town Carlos Alberto Lopes Asfora said: “In Brazil there are big parades, where thousands of civilians and military parade in the main roads of all major cities.” He said that it was also the start of the spring for Brazilians, and enjoying the beach was also a popular tradition on this day. He added it was the only Brazilian public holiday on which the consulate took the day off. He said the country’s independence meant a chance for Brazil to be responsible for its own destiny. “Brazil was a Portuguese colony from 1500. In 1808, when French troops led by Napoleon invaded Portugal, the king had to flee his country so he came to Rio,” Asfora said. “When Napoleon was defeated, the king went back and left the crown prince as regent and in 1822 the crown prince thought it was time for Brazil to be free. “It was a big day, Brazil became a state of its own. Before then it was always ruled from Lisbon, now it could be responsible for its own destiny.” Asfora said ties between Portugal and Brazil, however, remained strong. “We share the same language and culture so we have a strong connection,” he said. Asfora said when Brazil obtained its independence, there was minimal bloodshed, “It was not a traumatic experience,” he said. Asfora said it was a pleasure to be hosting a celebration in Cape Town. “We are in love with this city and it is an occasion to express our joy of being here and share our style of celebration.” Asfora said a local artist would be performing “Bossa Nova” music, a Brazilian style of music with a sort of classical jazz sound of African, European and American influences. Asfora said they had invited all consuls in the city, both official and honorary, and about 150 invited guests attended celebrations. Members of the Brazilian community in Cape Town had also been invited. The Brazilian embassy in Pretoria is scheduled to host a big celebration today.  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
