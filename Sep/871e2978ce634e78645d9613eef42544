She further said that the department of water and sanitation is currently assessing 12 water use license applications for abstraction of water by the City of Cape Town. Of the 12, three are for domestic and industrial use and the remaining nine for the construction of roads and houses in wetland areas within the city. Nomvula has communicated to Zille that three licenses for domestic and industrial purposes should be finalised by the end of this month. These are for the Berg Water Projects, the Theewaterskloof Dam and future abstractions from springs. The remaining licenses are being assessed. Cape Argus
