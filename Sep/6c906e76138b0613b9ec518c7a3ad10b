The pilgrimage around the Cape Peninsula is based on the centuries-old Camino de Santiago, which comprises a 780km walk across Spain. De Villiers said: “Out of frustration, I noticed there was so much fear in the world that is spreading. I just want to go and spread love through connecting people.” To ensure he didn’t get lost, De Villiers, also a peak performance coach, international speaker and best-selling author, was joined by local athlete Damien Hewitt. De Villiers’ journey was streamed live on Facebook and a series of short videos will be produced from the footage. The videos will showcase all the wonderful attractions and facilities on the route, encouraging the global market to come and walk the Cape Camino.Cape Camino representative Peggy Coetzee-Andrew said this challenge “will get people, local and foreign, walking our city and peninsula, bringing unity and sustainability for all”. “Our local version showcases our sacred diversity. We celebrate all of our diversity without bias: the Khoisan sacred way, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Hare Krishna, Afrikaans Calvinism, African traditionalism, Sufism.” She said the hike offered time away from people’s routines to ask life’s questions.
