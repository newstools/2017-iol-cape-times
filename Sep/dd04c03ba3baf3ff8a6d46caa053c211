Cosatu’s provincial secretary Tony Ehrenreich said 15 000 of its members would be taking part and that there would be no buses and taxis, only trains that will transport people to the march. The City’s director for safety and security, Richard Bosman, said it had approved an application from Cosatu for a gathering of no more than 10 000 people today. “City enforcement staff will assist the SAPS in monitoring the march. Staff will also be on hand to effect the necessary rolling road closures, which will be in place.” Mayoral committee member for transport and urban development Brett Herron said that they are expecting the MyCiTi services to operate normally. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: “Public Order Police, Flying Squad members, K-9, as well as other units will be deployed at identified locations in an effort to ensure safety and security for commuters and motorists. “The SAPS air wing will also be on stand-by. Police will be working closely with other law enforcement officials from metro police and traffic services to prevent road closures and traffic disruptions.” Golden Arrow bus services spokesperson Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said they did not anticipate any serious disruptions and intend to operate their regular scheduled services. Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker said Metrorail employees are unionised and none were expected to participate in the protest, but any participation would be on a “no work, no pay basis.” Taxi association Santaco general secretary Cecil Dibela said their members would not participate while Codeta spokesperson Andile Kanyi said they had not received any notification from unions to join. Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Janine Myburgh said: “Although we support freedom of expression, we don’t believe that mass strike action is the best way to effect real change. "A strike is disruptive  to an already fragile economy and puts further strain on the low rate of employment. It is the working class who suffer.”
