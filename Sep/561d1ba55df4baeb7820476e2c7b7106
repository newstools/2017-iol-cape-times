In a strongly worded statement yesterday, Masualle declared that the focus on high-level contact crimes, including crimes against women and children in the province, would continue to receive focus from the government. It is alleged that two armed men went on a killing spree in Ngunduza in the Kwetshe location around 9pm on Tuesday, first shooting and killing a 45-year-old woman at her home. Masualle said the woman’s 23-year-old son had witnessed her murder. It was further alleged that the gunmen then moved to another house nearby, where they shot and killed two women aged 60 and 49. Police said two children, aged 6, managed to escape and reported the incident to community members. “I urge all those with knowledge of this heinous crime to come forward and assist the SAPS in their investigations,” said Masualle. “To all women and children in our great province, the Home of Legends, allow me to reaffirm in your hearts and minds my and government’s unwavering commitment to making you feel safe and ensuring that you are safe and protected. “The SAPS are equally committed to leaving no stone unturned in the pursuit of those responsible and to bring them to justice,” he said. Police are investigating three murder cases, police spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha said. “The motives for the murders are unknown and will form part of the investigation,” he said. No arrests have yet been made and police are urging anyone with information on the killings to contact Centane police. Eastern Cape provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga “strongly condemned the senseless murders of defenceless women” and vowed that police would work around the clock.
