Cape Town - Thousands of people have begun their march down Keizersgracht Street in Cape Town. The march, organised as part of trade union federation Cosatu's national shutdown, took protesters to the offices of the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) to hand over a list of grievances, before proceeding to the Western Cape Provincial Legislature to hand over a memorandum.    The group will then march to Parliament to demand the removal of President Jacob Zuma, an end to corruption and action to be taken against state capture.    Up to 20 000 people were expected to be part of the protest.    Earlier on Wednesday, protesters called for the removal of Zuma as president of the ANC and the country.    Cosatu in the Western Cape is also outraged by the lack of a reliable train service by Metrorail under the auspices of Prasa, and the lack of safety of commuters who have become victims of crime while travelling by train.
