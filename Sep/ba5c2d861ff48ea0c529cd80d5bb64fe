Speaking at the opening of the Tax Indaba in Sandton last Monday, he said government recognises that tax morality is closely linked to the reduction in corruption. It’s often taken for granted that more than 26% of South Africans pay their taxes which helps to ensure the sovereignty of the country, he said, and added that government needs to do its part in ensuring that taxpayers’ money is used wisely and that efforts are taken to reduce wasteful expenditure. In contrast to the above he is willing to add another R10 billion to the bottomless pit that is SAA, and irregularly extended the tenure of SAA chairperson Dudu Myeni’s contract until the airline’s AGM in November. If that isn’t equal to wasting taxpayers’ money, what is? Nobody should take what Gigaba says seriously. Andre Venter Spokesperson of the trade union UASA
