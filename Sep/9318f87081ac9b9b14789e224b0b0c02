Ah-Sing said: “I almost thought this would happen in a previous CPF meeting, so this was a long time
coming. “Lianne Lippert is a passionate person and had felt that the lack of communication and partnership with the police, especially the station commander, had made it difficult for her to fulfil her duty.” Lippert said she resigned as the relationship was strained since she took office in 2015. “Our role is to hold police accountable, promote transparency and act as the link between the community and the police. “The station commander didn’t see this as our role and would not communicate with us, which is required by the police or otherwise it is a waste of everyone’s time.” She said the deputy would remain on the forum. Station commander Marius Stander said meetings were held in an attempt to resolve the issues. “Our last meeting ended on a positive note and the chairperson said a number of differences had been settled and committed to finding a workable way forward. “I am unable to comment on Lippert’s perception of her relationship with Milnerton SAPS management, except to say that we have at all times striven to maintain a healthy and active CPF,” added Stander. He said they respected the decision of the CPF members to step down.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
