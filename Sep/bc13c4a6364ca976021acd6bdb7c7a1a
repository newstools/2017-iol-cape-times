Cape Town - The discovery of the skeletal remains of an unknown woman near the Nekkies area of Worcester has rocked the Boland town. Construction workers made the gruesome find while busy with the extension of the Nekkies Bridge at the Old River Road. It is estimated that the body has been there for one or two years. Ward councillor Thorique Weir said very little was known about the circumstances of her death. “Construction workers were reported to have come across the skeleton and police are investigating the circumstances. "There seems to be little for them to go on as yet and we urge our community members to come forward if they have any information that could help,” said Weir. The community hoped that police would do everything within their power to identify the person, he said. Worcester Community Policing Forum chairperson Russel Cupido said he could not provide information and did not wish to jeopardise the police investigation. Police spokesperson Lindikhaya Nkontwana said: “The human remains are believed to be that of a female between the ages of 30 and 40 years and estimated to have been there for about one to two years. “Construction workers found the human skull peering from the dirt and the identity and cause of death are still unknown at this stage. "The deceased was wearing a red pair of gym shorts, a long navy-blue dress, cream blouse and a brown wool jacket,” said Nkontwana. The circumstances of how the woman ended up there could not be speculated on and the investigation was under way, he said. Anyone with information that may assist authorities to identify the woman can contact Worcester police on 0233486151 or 0233486107.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za  Cape Times
