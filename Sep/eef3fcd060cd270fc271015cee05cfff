The battle to prove the legitimacy of Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans (MKMVA) and ascertain who its real leaders are is far from over as the organisation finds itself split yet again. This comes in the wake of previous attempts by its leaders to make amends. Yesterday, the MK national council steering committee announced it was disregarding a separate conference held by the MKMVA in June, where Kebby Maphatsoe was re-elected as president and was instead forging ahead with an inclusive conference for all former Umkhonto weSizwe combatants. The two-day seminar that was meant to take place this month at the Nasrec Expo Centre, has been postponed to next month  to allow the ANC’s national executive committee to meet and address the challenges facing the veterans. Speaking at a media briefing held at the Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia yesterday, MK council leader General Siphiwe Nyanda said the upcoming conference, which 1 800 delegates are expected to attend, including the ANC’s top six and the ANC’s alliance partners, was a culmination of a consultative process to unite all the MK groups.
