The KwaZulu-Natal ANC provincial executive committee will know whether it will be dissolved or not within three days while the ANC seeks legal opinion. ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said on Friday following the ANC's special national executive committee (NEC) meeting that the NEC had resolved to seek legal opinion on whether to appeal the court judgment that declared the KwaZulu-Natal's 2015 elective conference unlawful. Mantashe said the province's leadership would know whether they would be dissolved or not before the party's NEC meeting next week. The NEC has also tasked the party's working committee to put in place a task team that will assist the ANC in KZN to prepare for a provincial conference. The date of the conference could take up to 9 months to be decided. Mantashe said the party was also concerned about courts being brought in to solve party issues. "The NEC does not believe that the NEC should continue to give reason to courts to intervene in the matters of the organisation which should be managed politically. The ANC must take must take charge of the issues facing the movement and deal with them decisively, " said Mantashe. The ANC has been faced with a number of court challenges; notably in the Eastern Cape and North West, with its various regions turning to the courts for respite. Mantashe also downplayed the question of whether the issues facing KwaZulu-Natal province would affect the party's national conference in December. He said the conference was about the branches and would not be affected by provincial structure issues. @ZintleMahlati Politics Hub
