The remaining suspect, Leroy Morris, 22, will stay behind bars until September 20 for a bail application. Cicero September, 41, and Mujahied Jacobs, 19, were released last week. Morris, wearing a T-shirt, jeans and carrying a towel, looked at those in attendance in the gallery and after the case was postponed, he greeted a friend in attendance. Jam Jam’s body was identified by her family almost a week after police found it at the Vygieskraal Stadium in Athlone, roughly 24km from her home. She had last spoken to her family while visiting her boyfriend, LInda Ntula, at his house in Mfuleni on July 22. When they did not hear from her for several days and she failed to honour an appointment she had with her mother that week, they opened a missing person’s case with the police. Jam Jam’s mother, Nomthandazo Jam Jam, had previously described Ntula as someone who was violent and jealous. Jam Jam’s boyfriend was arrested shortly after her death for charges related to several other cases. Ntula is awaiting trial. It is alleged he attempted to murder Jam Jam’s stepfather, Mike Mguga, earlier this year. Jam Jam’s parents told the Cape Times that police said bloodstains were found in one of Ntula’s cars and sent to the laboratory for testing. Her family said she was in an abusive relationship with Ntula, with whom she had a 2-year-old son.
