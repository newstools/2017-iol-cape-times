Makes one loaf  It can be wrapped and stored at room temperature for up to five days. Once cooled, and wrapped in plastic wrap, can be frozen for up to three months.  Ingredients: 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon (1/3 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup sugar 1 large egg 2 cups flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground mace 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 3/4 cup canned or cooked pumpkin purée 1/4 cup whole milk 1/4 cup crystallised ginger, finely chopped Method: Preheat the oven to 180ºC. Grease an 22cm-by-11cm loaf pan (preferably glass) with baking spray. Beat the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer or hand-held electric mixer on medium speed for a few minutes, until lightened. Add the sugar and beat on medium speed until well incorporated (the mixture will be grainy); stop to scrape down the bowl. Add the egg and beat (medium speed) until well incorporated and a bit fluffy; stop to scrape down the bowl. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, mace and cloves on a sheet of parchment or wax paper. Combine the pumpkin and milk in a large liquid measuring cup, stirring to incorporate. On medium-low speed, alternately add half-flour mixture, and then half the pumpkin mixture, beating until incorporated. Repeat with the remaining flour and pumpkin mixtures to form a thick batter. (This mixing can be done by hand as well.) Stir in the chopped crystallised ginger so it’s evenly distributed. Transfer the batter to loaf pan, smoothing it evenly. Bake (middle rack) for 55 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. The cake will be lightly browned at the edges and may develop a crack on top. Transfer (in the pan) to a wire rack to cool, then dislodge and cool the loaf directly on the rack for at least 20 minutes before serving. Cool completely before storing.
