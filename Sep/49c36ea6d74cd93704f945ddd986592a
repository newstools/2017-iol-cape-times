A 48-year-old man is due to to appear in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday for income tax fraud of several million rand, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) said. Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said that during the period 2008-2011, Moegamat Shafiek allegedly purposefully underdeclared his income, which resulted in the Receiver of Revenue (Sars) losing approximately R3.1 million. Khan was sought on a warrant of arrest after a case against him was registered in 2011, culminating in his arrest by the Hawks on September 15.
 
He appeared in court on the same day facing charges on the Fraud and Income Tax Act 58/1962. The matter was postponed to Wednesday for bail application.
