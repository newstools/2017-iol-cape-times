The US have frozen the assets and imposed other sanctions on South African terror-accused twins Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie for plotting a series of attacks on behalf of the Islamic State terrorist group against Jewish targets and the US embassy, according to reports on Tuesday. “Among other consequences, all of Tony-Lee Thulsie and Brandon-Lee Thulsie’s property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with them,” the release stated, according to news agency Sputnik. The brothers were arrested in 2016 by South African authorities before the attacks were carried out, the release said. Both men attempted to travel to Syria to fight for the Islamic State and Tony-Lee Thulsie communicated with the terrorist group to learn how to build bombs for terrorist attacks in South Africa, the release added. Meanwhile, the trial against the Thulsie twins is set to begin at the South Gauteng High Court on October 20. The Thulsie twins were arrested in July 2016 and have been charged with conspiracy and incitement to commit the crime of terrorism and conspiring and attempting to commit acts associated with terrorist activities.
