Zanele’s body was dumped in an open field in TR Section, Lingelethu West last week. Her clothes were removed except for a bra and a shoe. A bottle was stuffed in her mouth. Her daughter, aged 2, is now an orphan. The child’s father died last year. The family is not happy that a 28-year-old man was released even though the DNA  results have not been concluded yet. “No ways, they cannot release him, but they are still waiting for DNA  results,” said Sandlwana’s sister Amanda. Zanele’s aunt Lumka Ntloko said: “The police say they are will update us frequently. In the next three months we will check with them and if nothing happens then we can talk to the media.” Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: “There are no new developments.”
