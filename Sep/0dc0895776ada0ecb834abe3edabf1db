The committee has been tasked to submit the names of 12 candidates to the National Assembly, which will make recommendations to President Jacob Zuma. Zuma is expected to make the appointment to the permanent board before the expiry of the six-month term of the interim board led by Khanyisile Kweyama. Committee chairperson Humphrey Maxegwana said their meeting tomorrow would deliberate on the interviews. “We had fruitful engagements with the candidates and are confident all of them combined possess a set of various expertise required in the board,” Maxegwana said. The committee still has to receive a report on the verification of the candidates’ academic qualifications and security clearances. Candidates had been given forms to sign to give 
consent for the verification of their qualifications and security vetting. This was aimed at avoiding the repeat of an incident when former board chairman Ellen Tshabalala was found to have misrepresented her 
qualifications. During last week’s interviews people boasting various skills and expertise were interviewed for the 12 non-executive board positions. They included the interim board of the SABC, which includes Kweyama, deputy chairman Mathatha Tsedu, Krish Naidoo, John Matisonn and Febe Potgieter-Gqubule. Others that were interviewed were former SABC board members Desmond Golding and Rachel Kalidass, former Accountant-General Michael Sass, Media Development and Diversity Agency (MDDA) board member Louise Vale, Corruption Watch’s Leanne Govindsamy, Bongi Ngema-Zuma Foundation chairman Bongumusa Makhathini, actor Devnarain Jack and former Icasa councillor Nomvuyiso Batyi. Although the committee had shortlisted 36 candidates, two could not appear before the multi-party interview panel. Political Bureau
