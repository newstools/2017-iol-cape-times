A seven-month-old baby died and three other people were seriously injured when a car and a truck collided on Ottery Road near Schaapkraal in Cape Town on Saturday afternoon, paramedics said.
 
Shortly before 2pm, paramedics from ER24, Metro emergency medical services (EMS), Life Healthcare and traffic and fire and rescue services arrived on the scene, ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said. “The seven-month-old baby was found outside the vehicle. It is believed that the child was ejected during the collision. "Three occupants, two adults and a seven-year-old [child], were found trapped inside the vehicle. “Fire and rescue services had to use hydraulic equipment to free them from the wreckage. Once freed, they were treated and rushed to Groote Schuur Hospital. "The driver of the truck was not found on the scene.”
 
The cause of the accident was not yet known, but local authorities were investigating, Vermaak said on Sunday. African News Agency
