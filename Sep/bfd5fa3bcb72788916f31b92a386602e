In Parliament yesterday, briefing the social development portfolio committee, Dlamini sought to dispel doubts about the tie-up between the South African Social Security Agency and the Post Office. She told the committee that due diligence was being undertaken on the Post Office to ensure that it had the requisite skills to provide the service. “It has nothing with us not wanting to work with the Post Office. We do want to work with the Post Office,” she said. Dlamini’s comments come a day after Sassa officials appeared before the standing committee on public accounts (Scopa), where they reported on the two-week delay in concluding an agreement with the Post Office. Scopa has also expressed its concern that Sassa was outsourcing some functions linked to the payment of social grants to tender in an apparent belief that the Post Office would not be able to manage certain aspects of the system. This included the third-party deductions from grants being outsourced to private company Queue Systems. Scopa was told that Sassa was instructed by the inter-ministerial task team to do “due diligence” on the Post Office proposal before finalising the agreement. Dlamini said the role of the Post Office in Sassa work had been identified by the “work streams”. “We are already doing some work with the Post Office. We signed some agreement with them,” she said. Dlamini also said the Post Office was requested to submit its proposal because it had been felt that as a government entity it should be given priority. “They have responded and we had to start with due diligence.” She indicated that there were other companies that applied or responded to the tender, but at the end of day “we thought another government institution will be much better and cheaper”.
