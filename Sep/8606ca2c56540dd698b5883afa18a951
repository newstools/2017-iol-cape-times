After working behind the scenes on events ranging from the election of Margaret Thatcher to the death of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, Bell Pottinger has been brought down by a scandal of its own making. On Tuesday, it was thrown out of a British industry body for running a campaign in support of President Jacob Zuma. That campaign was deemed to have deliberately inflamed racial tensions, prompting clients to ditch the firm, among them HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank. Leaked e-mails showed that Bell Pottinger had said the campaign needed to stress the continued “existence of economic apartheid”. The communications preceded a sustained campaign condemning enemies of Zuma, including pro-business
elements of Zuma’s ANC, as agents of “white monopoly capital”. Bell Pottinger was paid £100000 (R1.6 million) a month by Oakbay, the holding company of the Guptas, which has been accused of using its closeness to Zuma to win government contracts. Zuma and the Guptas deny any wrongdoing. Its second-biggest shareholder, Chime, has written off its 25% stake and its chief executive and biggest investor have quit. It is now fighting to retain clients and key staff. “We have appointed BDO to look at all options for the business including a possible sale,” a Bell Pottinger spokesperson said. Bell Pottinger was founded in 1987, after co-founder Tim Bell helped get Thatcher elected as Britain’s first female prime minister. It works to protect clients’ reputations, “whatever the size of challenge”. Past clients included Kremlin critic Boris Berezovsky, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and a foundation for the memory of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
