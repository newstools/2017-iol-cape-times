The dome-like structure in its shell stage is taking shape just outside the Company's Garden and is set to be launched on October 7 - Tutu's 86th birthday. Traffic around the intersection was backed up during peak-morning traffic, as one lane was closed. Design Indaba project manager Robyn-Lee Pretorius said the project was conceived last year. “Mayor Patricia de Lille approached Design Indaba to herald Archbishop Desmond Tutu and his life's work. We conceptualised An Arch for Arch, a public art piece with 14 timber members, each representing one of the 14 chapters of the constitution. “It is here that we looked for inspiration from Snøhetta, a Norwegian architectural company, to design the artwork, and partnered with Local Studio, a South African architectural practice, to produce the work.” The concept was launched on March 3 at Design Indaba Conference 2017, with Tutu present, Pretorius said. The temporary structure will be completed in the first week of October, ahead of the ribbon-cutting ceremony and dedication on Tutu’s birthday, and will be there for a period of five years. Pretorius confirmed a traffic permit for road closure was applied for. City spokesperson Sellecca Lang did not respond to questions regarding the traffic congestion and why the green light was given for construction to take place during peak traffic hours, and directed queries to the Design Indaba/ Interactive Africa company.
