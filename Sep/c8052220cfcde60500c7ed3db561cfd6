Cape Town - In an effort to allow users to be more expressive, Twitter said that it has started testing 280-character tweets, doubling the previous character limits. “Our research shows us that the character limit is a major cause of frustration for people tweeting in English,” the company said in a blog post. “When people don’t have to cram their thoughts into 140 characters and actually have some to spare, we see more people Tweeting which is awesome!” Lengthening the character limit may result in more engaging conversation on the platform hopes Twitter. The move is set to aid its bid to turn itself into a destination for live events and discussion. It includes all languages except Japanese, Korean and Chinese.     - Business Report Online
