Cape Town - The ANC in Nyanga emerged victorious with a 71% majority after Ward 37 held by-elections contested by six parties on Wednesday.
The ANC says the win is a good foundation as it heads towards the 2019 national government elections. The ANC retained the seat it won in the 2016 local government municipal elections. However, the majority was reduced - 76.74% was achieved in the 2016. Luyanda Nyingwa is now the ward representative. Electoral Commission spokesperson Kate Bapela said the voter turnout was 38.19%. The PAC representative, Thulani Pike, came second with 18%. The DA and EFF garnered 6% each. “The people of Nyanga have shown the confidence they have for the ANC in great numbers,” said ANC Dullah Omar region spokesperson Khaya Yozi. He said the 71% was “an overwhelming majority which signals the strength of a united ANC under the Dullah Omar leadership”. ANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the support from the voters was humbling. “The ANC does not take this support for granted and remains committed to ensuring that the city delivers (for) the people of Nyanga and the black communities of Cape Town in general. “We will use this victory to give further impetus to our campaign to reclaim the City of Cape Town and the Western Cape.” He thanked ANC supporters for their “tireless work which resulted in the victory for the people’s movement”. PAC representative Thulani Pike said the by-election had produced good results for the party. “We did three times better than the DA. We are pleased with the number of votes, it shows we are growing.” DA provincial campaigns manager Anthony Benadie said: “We accept the defeat and will continue campaigning as we go to the 2019 elections.” Cape Times
