Cape Town - "It's important to know where you come from, to know where you're going." We've all heard a version of this quote before and, for a journalist, it's vital to know the back story, the history and context when reporting current events. But while we know a lot about the back story of South Africa as a nation, we thought we would get personal this time around. We asked Independent Media staff and the public about their family heritage. Where did your grandparents and great grandparents come from?

This Heritage Day we are celebrating the diverse and unique back stories of proud South Africans. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
