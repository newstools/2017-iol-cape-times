Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has been accused of colluding with the Presidency and the State Security to hurt the central bank and undercut its authority. The public protector is being accused by the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb), according to EyeWitness News. According to an affidavit that was submitted on Monday, just a few weeks before Mkhwebane released her Bankorp report, the public protector met a number of parties to debate amending the Reserve Bankâ€™s constitutional power and mandate. The Bankorp report, by Mkhwebane was released in June. This action to change the constitution was set aside by the High Court. Johannes de Jager, from the Reserve Bank, said the public protector revealed a number of records and documents in the run-up to the Bankorp review application. The documents were beforehand named confidential or deemed private. The affidavit also showed that the Reserve Bank was not allowed to see the report before it was released. The EyeWitness report also states that Mkhwebane met the State Security Agency and while in the briefing asked or discussed how vulnerable they were. De Jager said that these actions illustrate that the matter had changed from investigating the CIEX report to a Reserve Bank attack. Mkhwebane was asked to please explain herself and her actions in the affidavit.       Also Read: #ReserveBankPP: Mkhwebane's remedial action on SARB set aside. -BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
