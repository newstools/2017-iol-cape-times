The 25-year-old man had handed himself over to police after the murder of the young mother of two. It is alleged that he struck her over the head several times with a shovel in full view of her family and friends. The victim’s cousin Joseph Ryk, acting as the family spokesperson, said the accused went into a jealous rage after they argued at her mother’s home at Vergenoegd farm on Saturday. He said the family had asked the State prosecutor to not allow the accused to be granted bail. “His family were there ready to pay his bail, but the magistrate said his actions showed he did not have any respect for human life and he was denied bail. "The owners of Vergenoegd Farm, where she worked, held a memorial service for her today and everyone on the farm was still very emotional,” said Ryk. He said the suspect would make his next appearance on October 9. The woman had a child with the accused, a nine-month-old baby, and a 4-year-old son from a former relationship, Ryk said. He said the eldest child, along with other family members and friends, witnessed the murder and they were awaiting assistance and counselling. De Doorns Community Policing Forum chairperson Jean Amsterdam said the accused had appeared in court and would remain in custody in Worcester prison until his next court appearance. He said the murder had rocked their community. However, they were satisfied with the swift action of the police in apprehending the suspect and for the court’s zero tolerance towards perpetrators of violence against women and children. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed the suspect was still in custody following his appearance in court yesterday. National Prosecuting Agency spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila did not respond to queries by deadline. Provincial Social Development Department spokesperson Sihle Ngobese said the department would issue a statement regarding counselling for the family today.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
