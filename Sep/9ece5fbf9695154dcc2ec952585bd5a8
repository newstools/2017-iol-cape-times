Two people were killed and another seriously injured after a truck overturned on the N1 coming into the Cape Town city centre at the Koeberg interchange on Wednesday morning. The container truck overturned and landed on top a sedan vehicle, causing huge traffic disruption. “The driver of the truck sustained serious injuries and both occupants of the sedan were fatally injured,” said City of Cape Town Traffic Services spokeswoman Maxine Bezuidenhout. “The cause of the accident is yet to be determined.” According to the ER24 paramedic service, the truck driver had sustained a serious head injury and was in a critical condition. “The man was immediately treated for his injuries and provided with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, the man was transported to Vincent Palotti Hospital for urgent care,” ER24 said. “Metro rescue services had to use a specialised crane the remove the container off of the light motor vehicle, an operation lasting some time. Once the container had been lifted, paramedics found the bodies of two men lying trapped inside their vehicle.” The N1 incoming remained closed. Motorists were advised to use the N2 highway or Voortrekker Road to make their way into the city centre. African News Agency
