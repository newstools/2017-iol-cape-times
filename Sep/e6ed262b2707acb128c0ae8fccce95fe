Johannesburg - Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba on Monday denied allegations that National Treasury requested funds from the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) to bail out ailing state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Last week, reports emerged that Treasury was pushing the PIC, Africa’s biggest money manager, to come up with as much as R100 billion to fund SOEs. The South African Federation of Trade Unions and DA have since slammed this planned move, warning Gigaba to keep his hands of the PIC billions. Treasury in a statement said the minister has noted the media reports relating to the use of PIC funds "with concern". "The minister would like to clarify that these reports are untrue. No formal or informal request has been sent to the PIC for such funds. "The minister finds these reports malicious and unconstructive."

The department added that Gigaba has since called an urgent meeting with the PIC board to deal with this matter and other pressing issues. "More information on the meeting will be provided soon," Treasury said. IOL
