Hyde Park Primary pupil Ezra was playing outside when he was caught in crossfire and shot in his neck. He died at the scene. Prosecutor Helene Booysen said during court proceedings the Junky Funkys and a 27s gang member were involved in  the shooting which fatally wounded the Parkwood boy. Tasliem Bianchi, Ikeraam Bianchi, Marlon Neehuis, Kelly Daniels and Kimberley Solomons stand accused of the murder and appeared in court  for a bail application yesterday. Two additional charges - possession of an unlicensed firearm and possession of ammunition - were added to the charge sheet. The bail hearing has been postponed until October 26 and all the accused will remain in custody at Pollsmoor prison until then. “We are still awaiting the crime scene photographs, ballistic reports, forensic information, postmortem results. Gang profiling will also be done,” Booysen said. She added that the investigation was not complete and the accused were in the dock as they
were the occupants of a white vehicle from which one shot was fired which fatally wounded the boy. Booysen said a petition with 210 signatures was handed in from community members calling for no bail. She said the State would be opposing bail. Outside court a large group of supporters could be heard chanting “no bail” for the accused. Ezra’s parents were seen attending court proceedings and left the packed courthouse speedily after the accused had appeared. Ezra was buried from his parents' home on Saturday.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
