Cape Town - The Office of the Deputy Minister of Police Mr Bongani Mkongi said in a statement that he is disappointed by fake reports from some media houses that two police officers were shot and killed in Hanover Park. "The media is requested not to report recklessly on issues but to confirm information with official credible sources that can be quoted in media articles. As a department we are concerned and disappointed in the reckless reporting behaviour of the journalists and will pursue the matter with the Press Ombudsman." Two officers however sustained slight injuries after SAPS members came under attack from an angry mob of community members when they tried to apprehend a murder suspect.
