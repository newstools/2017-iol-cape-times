CAPE TOWN - Future South Africa welcomes Cosatu's anti state capture actions. FutureSA in a statement called on South Africans to support the nationwide strike action organised by Cosatu. "We welcome the planned action by the labour federation, as well as the support it has received from the business community and other civil society formations," they said. They said they are of the view that the national strike is yet another indication of the visible public anger against corruption and state capture. "strike action across all nine provinces is significant in that it is the first mass demonstration organised by a labour federation against state capture." FutureSA said they hope the mass protests are just the start of an intensified campaign by Cosatu against the capture, but they also not that it is only when all worker federations embark on unified action that will be able to meanignfully roll back state capture and lay the basis for its complete eradication. "The allegations of Public Investment Corporation (PIC) coffers being raided to bail out state owned entities (SOE’s) is a cause for great concern for all South Africans, and especially the working class," FutureSA stated. "FutureSA hopes that workers can unite against the pension fund being looted to keep afloat SOE’s that are in crisis today because of corruption and state capture. Nothing short of intensive mass action and pressure will prevent this disaster from happening," FutureSA concluded. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
