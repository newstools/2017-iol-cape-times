CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley said the first year student was participating in a residence outing in Maidens Cove. “The student was swept from rocks while scrambling down rocks towards the beach. Her parents have been informed. Trauma counselling will be made available to the grieving students who were also on the trip,” Kansley said. National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) spokesperson Craig Lambinon said just after 4pm on Saturday NSRI Bakoven duty crew were  activated by the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) following eye-witness reports of the group being swept off the rocks. NSRI rescue swimmers in the vicinity at the time responded directly to the scene. An NSRI Table Bay rescue vehicle was also dispatched and Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services dive unit, Community Medics, Emergency services, police, the AMS/EMS Skymed rescue helicopter and ER24 ambulance services also responded. Rescuers found bystanders assisting the student, who was originally form Bloemfontein, out of the water from among the rocks and performing CPR (Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation) on her. After paramedics and emergency services arrived on the scene and continued CPR efforts, she was taken to hospital. After all attempts to resuscitate her were exhausted, she was declared dead by doctors." Lambinon said other people who were swept off the rocks had managed to climb out of danger uninjured.
