Yesterday marked World Suicide Prevention Day under the theme "Take a minute, change a life", and the department’s Mental Health Review Board, which considers and reviews all admissions of mental health care users under the Mental Health Care Act, says it has seen a spike in mental health admissions since 2015. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15 to 29-year-olds, claiming 800 000 lives globally, according to the World Health Organisation. Lentegeur Hospital Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service head Dr Rene Nassen said substance use and abuse was a "significant precipitant" for adolescent presentations of mental health symptoms. “This frequently leads to self-harm and other impulsive, high-risk behaviours,” said Nassen. She said psychiatric and psychological factors such as the presence of mental illnesses, including depression and anxiety may precipitate suicidal behaviour among adolescents. “Other factors include adverse life events and distress caused by family, physical or sexual abuse and bullying. More recently, cyberbullying has also been noted as a contributing factor. Adolescent suicidal tendencies are also arising in the LGBTI group." South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) operations director Cassey Chambers said: “We’d like all South Africans to know they can make a difference in someone’s life simply by taking a minute to check in with them.” Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo said: “Communities can provide social support to vulnerable individuals and engage in follow-up care, fight stigma and support those bereaved by suicide. "Stigma attached to mental disorders and suicide means many may feel unable to seek help.” Meanwhile, more than 200 pairs of shoes were laid out on the Sea Point Promenade in an event organised by the Movember Foundation. Each pair of shoes was a silent testimony to the men who lose their lives in our country each month to 
suicide.
