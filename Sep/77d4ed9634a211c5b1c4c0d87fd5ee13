Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday dismissed a "deliberate" social media smear campaign against him. "The office of the deputy president is aware of social media messages which take the form of media enquiries from a Sunday newspaper that make various claims about Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa’s personal life," his acting spokesperson Tyrone Seale said. "There is no doubt that these messages have been circulated as part of a deliberate campaign to smear the person of the deputy president. "They are a transparent attempt to distort personal email correspondence that could only have been obtained through criminal means."
 
"The deputy president will in due course release a detailed statement on the allegations contained in the messages," Seale said. African News Agency
