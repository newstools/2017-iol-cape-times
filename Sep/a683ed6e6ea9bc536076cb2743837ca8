The 26-year-old man involved in the Paarl viral road rage video said he has forgiven the man he claimed called him a “hotnot” and hit him in the face with a pickaxe handle. In a new video shared more than 5 000 times, Egan Vorster and the other driver, Marius Geldenhuys, wash each other’s feet, embrace and pray together. Originally from Bloemfontein, Vorster said his spirituality had guided him in making peace with Geldenhuys. “I turned to my faith and prayed on the matter before meeting with Marius. It was a surreal experience, but I felt the sincerity and remorse from him and chose to forgive this man rather than keep condemning him,” said Vorster. He said after Geldenhuys told him of his personal situation, he understood where the anger came from and believed Geldenhuys was sincere in his apology. Vorster’s first video had over 7 000 shares, of him and Geldenhuys embroiled in an a argument following a near collision. He posted that Geldenhuys had allegedly called him a “hotnot” before the two had pulled over and Geldenhuys, once realising he was being filmed, hit him with a pickaxe handle in the face. He asked anyone who knew the man to tag him so his identity could be known. This resulted in a friend of Geldenhuys’ reaching out to the young man to help bring the two together. Vorster said he chose the humbling act of feet washing as a gesture because with racial tensions boiling over in the country, he would rather show an alternative in forgiveness. Vorster said he hoped people will learn from his experience and rather see opportunities within differences instead of the barriers.
