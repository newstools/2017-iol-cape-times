Monday marked slain Courtney’s crown birthday and, what should have been a joyous occasion, was instead celebrated with a memorial service. The toddler, whose body was found on a rubbish heap in Bofors Circle, Epping Industria, would have celebrated her fourth birthday on Monday. Her mother, Juanita Pieters, sobbed as a group who gathered to support the family sang the gospel hymn, “You will always be a child in God’s eyes”. A birthday party will be hosted on Saturday afternoon for Courtney.  Speaking briefly to the media, Pieters said: “It's not a nice feeling at all. This morning I just lay and thought about her. We really miss her so much. But through God’s will everything is possible.” To commemorate her short life, a memorial service was held at their family home from where she went missing about four months ago.

Courtney went missing on May 4 from her Pluto Street home in Salberau. A nine-day search ensued before her body was found in the industrial area. The man arrested for her rape and murder, Mortimer Saunders, was a tenant in the family home for three years and was a childhood friend of Courtney’s father. The State confirmed at his last court appearance that  they intend to take the matter to the Western Cape High Court. Saunders will be back in the dock in October and remains in custody. Cape Times
