Johannesburg - Former Gupta PR firm Bell Pottinger will appeal the decision by the Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA) to uphold a complaint laid by the DA, the party confirmed on Friday. Last month, it was announced that the PRCA had decided to uphold the DA's complaint against the UK-based PR firm The DA had lodged a complaint with the association, accusing Bell Pottinger of violating its Professional Charter and Code of Conduct through its work with Oakbay Capital and the Gupta family. Phumzile van Damme, DA shadow Minister of Communications, confirmed that the PR firm had submitted an appeal to the PRCA's decision. "The PRCA board of Management will now meet again on September 4 to consider this appeal and will issue its final ruling on September 5," van Damme said. "The DA looks forward to the outcome of the ruling and we trust that PRCA will make the right decision in holding Bell Pottinger accountable." Bell Pottinger originally came under fire when their working relationship with Oakbay was exposed, prompting them to cut ties with the company. The PR firm has since issued an apology over the saga.
