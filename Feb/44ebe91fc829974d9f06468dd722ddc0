Following the release of the report, officials from the Department of Environmental Affairs and the city met on January 23 to discuss the way forward, said Rudolf van Jaarsveldt, the spokesperson at the province s directorate for strategic and operational support at the Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning.The contraventions constitute a significant danger to the health and well-being of Masiphumelele residents, according to the report. The directive ordered a progress report to be submitted within 14 days of its issue. Community activist Rosemary Milbank said she complained for months to have the provincial government go to Masiphumelele for an inspection. They were all shocked at what they saw. This is not about rubbish in the streets of Masiphumelele, but disgusting living conditions in the area.
