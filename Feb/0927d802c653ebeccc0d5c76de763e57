Johannesburg The taxi in this short clip takes unroadworthy to a whole new level.Posted on the CICA (Crime Intelligence &amp; Community Awareness) YouTube channel, the video shows a badly damaged white Toyota Quantum, which has clearly been in a rollover collision, being driven merrily along a freeway with total disregard for the kind of danger that such a wreck poses to everyone around it.One can only hope that it was on its way to a scrap yard rather than being used to transport passengers.
