Twenty-six pupils were injured during a stampede after a Valentine s Day concert at Orleansvale Primary School in Paarl. The children, mainly from the lower grades, were hurt after Friday's concert as pupils rushed to their classrooms to collect their bags at the end of the school day. A mother, who asked not to be named, said her 10-year-old son was slightly hurt. He said the fashion show ended and they were on their way to fetch their bags, as school was out. There was a mad rush by the older kids through the exit, and the smaller kids who were in the hallway already were overrun when they came through. The mother said her son suffered minor injuries. I went to the hospital and was told what happened. I understand children can be impulsive and rash, especially at that time of day on a Friday. &quot;Accidents happen, but like many of the other parents, we want to know who was monitoring the children. She said some of the parents were discussing approaching the principal at school today to demand answers. Health Department spokesperson Bianca Carls confirmed 26 children had been admitted to the Paarl Hospital s Emergency Centre. The ages of the children range from seven to 13 and all of them received medical assistance. The doctor on duty reported no serious injuries among the children who were attended to at the emergency centre. Carls said only soft tissue injuries were sustained and all the children were discharged the same day.The Department of Education did not respond before deadline.
