Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) boss Robert McBride has hit back at acting national commissioner of police Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane for claiming not to have been notified about a probe into him.Briefing the portfolio committee on police yesterday, McBride said Phahlane s recent denials to the committee were false. We have documentary proof that not only was he informed about it, but his own signature is on the document asking his PA (personal assistant) to schedule a meeting regarding the case, and that s as early as June 2016, McBride said.He also said they had proof that Phahlane had met with former acting executive director Israel Kgamanyane to discuss the investigation. He added: Unfortunately for Phahlane, we have recordings of every interview. Phahlane is facing an Ipid probe in connection with his R8 million house and a fleet of vehicles as well as links with a service provider that did business with the police when he headed the forensic unit. McBride also told MPs that the police watchdog had several statements and documented proof, including bank statements, of events that implicated Phahlane in corruption, money laundering, fraud and defeating the ends of justice. We also found that there is a pattern of whistle-blowers being harassed, threatened and victimised, he said.Asked what he made of the arrests of private investigator Paul O Sullivan and his lawyer, McBride said it was an attempt to disrupt the Ipid investigation. It is intimidation and it is contravention of section 33 of the Ipid Act. There is already a defeating the ends of justice case which is based on the fact that General Phahlane called people to not co-operate with us. We have statements to that effect, he said.McBride s Ipid colleague Matthews Sisoko brushed off criticism of the search warrant Ipid obtained to conduct a raid at Phahlane s house, saying it was lawfully obtained.
