Former US president Barack Obama is a failed leader whose foreign policies on Africa were built on shaky ground, and he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for doing nothing .And the unrealistic expectation that he was to become the Messiah of Africa during his eight-year presidency did not come even close to fruition.In fact, the reason that he would go down in the annals of history as the first African American to occupy the White House was, more than anything, about Obama fulfilling his personal ambitions that his late father had failed to realise.These were the remarks of Professor Adekeye Adebajo, director of the Institute for Pan-African Thought and Conversation at the University of Johannesburg (UJ).He was speaking during a public dialogue titled Obama s Africa Legacy: A Triumph of Symbolism? held at the UJ Kingsway Campus in Auckland Park, Joburg, yesterday.Adebajo described Obama, who stepped down to make way for 45th US President Donald Trump last month, as a conflicted leader who supported strong democratic institutions for sub-Saharan Africa while preferring autocratic leadership for the Arab world.He said Obama had merely continued his predecessor George W Bush s policies on the &quot;war on terror&quot;, as the kidnapping of terrorism suspects and their unlawful detention and torture continued unabated under his watch. US drone strikes had killed scores of civilians, he added.Adebajo said the greatest disappointment for Africa was that the former leader of the free world treated Africa as European spheres of influence .He also criticised the Nobel Committee's decision to award Obama the Nobel Peace Prize for just not being George W Bush , a mere nine months into his presidency.However, not all was doom and gloom as the professor commended Obama s support for UN peacekeeping missions in Africa, and mediation efforts in South Sudan and the Great Lakes region.Obama had also managed to increase the number of people having access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs, and he spearheaded the Young African Leaders Initiative.Wits University visiting professor John Stremlau seemed to express sympathy for Obama s administration, describing the civilian deaths by drone strikes as regrettable.He admitted to having a lot of confidence in Obama, who he described as a careful decision-maker .Choosing his words carefully, Stremlau said Obama inherited the worst financial crisis and that he was a leader who respected the rule of law.The dialogue was preceded by the screening of the documentary Senator Obama goes to Africa.Former first lady Zanele Mbeki and officials from the embassies of the US, Sweden and Nigeria attended the event. @luyolomkentane
