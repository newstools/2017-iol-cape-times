The media should be barred from revealing the identities of child victims, offenders and witnesses even after the age of 18, unless a court gives the go-ahead in a specific case.This was the argument on behalf of children s rights groups, which yesterday asked the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, to gag the media from revealing children's identities.The Centre for Child Law, Childline and National Institute for Crime Prevention and Reintegration of Offenders (Nicro), wants the court to provide more clarity as to the rights of these children. It wants the court to interpret the Criminal Procedure Act as to mean that it protected the rights of these children, even after they had turned 18 years old.&nbsp;Judge Wendy Hughes was asked to refer back the provisions which protect the rights of children to the legislature for reconsideration, if it was, in its current form, not flexible enough to bar the media from identifying these children.The law protects the identity of child witnesses and child offenders involved in criminal cases. It wasunderstood by the media that once a child offender or witness had turned 18, that person was no longer considered a child and thus no longer protected by the law.The law is, however, unclear on whether a child victim under 18 is protected by the law.&nbsp;This issue came to light during the Zephany Nurse case the girl who was kidnapped from a hospital shortly after she was born. It was only when she was 17 years and nine months old that her biological parentsfound her.&nbsp;The media wanted to publish her identity once she turned 18, but Nurse, identified in court papers only as KL, wanted to protect her identity, as she said the matter was traumatic.Nurse, with the aid of the Centre for Child Law, obtained an order barring the media from identifying her, pending the outcome of this week s legal battle.&nbsp;Media houses, including Independent Media, yesterday agreed that this order remained in place pending the outcome of any appeals which may follow.The applicants argued that the law should also protect child victims from identification, and not only child witnesses and offenders. It also wants the protection of these three categories to continue after they have turned 18.Advocate Steven Budlender, acting for the applicants, said this blanket ban should prevail until a court specifically gave permission in certain cases that the identity could be revealed.Advocate Wim Trengove SC, on the other hand, argued on behalf of the media that that there were adequate laws in place to protect children. He argued that having a free media was a vital part of a democracy and that a ban on publication should only be made on a case-by-case basis.He said placing a blanket ban on ever identifying these three categories of children after they had turned 18 would go too far in limiting the right of freedom of expression.&nbsp;Both parties, however, agreed that the issues at stake were not merely how to protect the rights of children, but &nbsp;how to strike a balance between open justice and the rights of children.The arguments are proceeding.
