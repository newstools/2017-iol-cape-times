The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has opened a case of crimen injuria against the DA s provincial chairman in Pietermaritzburg for alleged racist remarks.ANC provincial spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli said the case was opened at the Mountain Rise police station in Pietermaritzburg.According to the ANC, Mergan Chetty is alleged to have called foreigners makwerekwere during a conversation with Lungisani Sikhakhane, a former DA councillor who defected to the ANC. The ANC rejects the use of the word makwerekwere by Chetty considering the fact that in this province we experienced xenophobic attacks a few years ago, said Ntuli.Seven people were killed in the attacks.He said the ANC would call on the Human Rights Commission to investigate Chetty and the DA for human rights violation.Meanwhile, the case against a former activist from the DA accused of making defamatory allegations against Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip was postponed in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court on Wednesday.The matter was transferred to the regional court where the the trial against Nonthutuzelo Jack was expected to get under way. However, she was not at court due to a fractured leg. Forty-seven-year old Jack from Tshwete Village, is accused of defaming Trollip by claiming he offered her a bribe to dig up dirt on DA provincial chairperson Veliswa Mvenya.According to the charge sheet, Jack is facing a charge of criminal defamation for falsely accusing Trollip of having offered her money in exchange for working for his faction in the party, digging up dirt on Mvenya and adding her name to the DA s candidate list for the 2016 municipal elections.The charge sheet further reads that Jack deposed of an affidavit containing false accusations and forwarded it to DA federal executive chairperson James Selfe.The case was postponed until March 6.
