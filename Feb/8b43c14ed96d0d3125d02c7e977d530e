A 21-year-old Durban preacher is expected to appear in court on Monday charged with the rape of an 8-year-old boy. The preacher was arrested on Friday following an investigation by the Pinetown Family Violence Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the alleged rape took place at the preacher s house in Kwangcolosi near Hillcrest. She said the boy and three friends were playing outside the preacher s house when he sent the friends to buy airtime and the child was called into the home. The boys returned with the airtime and gave it to the preacher, who took it and closed the door. The 8-year-old was still in the house. Later, when the other boys were about to leave, they called the boy inside the house. He came out and they left together, said Gwala. A few days later, the preacher called another boy into his home, but the boy refused and when questioned by his mother about his disobedience, the boy alleged that the preacher had kissed him. The boy told her that the last time he was with the preacher he kissed him, said Gwala. She said the boy also reported the alleged rape of his friend by the preacher. His mother then informed the rape victim s mother, who reported the crime.
