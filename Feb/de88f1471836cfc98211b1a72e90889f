Junaid Arendse, who touched hearts throughout the country in his brave battle against cancer, has been given two to three weeks to live, with his family saying his cancer has returned in a full-blown state. In June 2015, doctors gave Junaid, 7, just three months to live after he was diagnosed with stage four cancer. His only hope was Topotecan, an expensive anti-cancer drug treatment not available in state hospitals. The Mitchells Plain boy had previously undergone numerous sessions of chemotherapy at the Red Cross War Memorial Children s Hospital since the cancer was diagnosed in May 2014. This treatment, however, was no longer sufficient and the family raised funds for Topotecan. Thanks to donations from generous Cape Times readers, friends, supporters and his school, Hazeldene Primary, more than R150000 was raised for his treatment.&nbsp;Large amounts were donated by high-profile locals, including mayor Patricia de Lille, who donated R25 000 to the family, and comedians Kurt Schoonraad, Marc Lottering, Stuart Taylor and Nik Rabinowitz, who put on a show in aid of Junaid at the Cape Town Comedy Club. They raised R60 000. In September 2015, test results showed that the cancer had been eradicated from his upper body. Two months later, doctors gave the go-ahead to remove the tumour. However, three weeks ago, Junaid s family said he was taken to Red Cross for a check-up, where the cancer was found to have returned. Doctors have told the family that Junaid has a few weeks left to live. But against the odds and his prognosis, Junaid is still an active boy. He rides his bike, plays with his cousins and even attends school when his pain subsides.
