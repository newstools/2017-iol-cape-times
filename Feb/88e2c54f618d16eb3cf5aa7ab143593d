CONCERNS over some of the negative impacts of mining on poor communities formed a key part of the discussions at yesterday s eighth Alternative Mining Indaba (AMI). The issues around mining involve land grabs, pollution, resettlement (of community land acquired by mines) and compensation proceeds and employment systems, said Malawian Roman Catholic priest, Father Denis Chitete.He said: For a long time Malawi was said to be a country without minerals, but recently mineral deposits have been discovered and companies have come in to extract these. There s talk about oil and gas under Lake Malawi. He said unfettered mining brought issues of environmental degradation and tax evasion in which growth in the extraction industry did not benefit local people,or the government. As a church we are concerned, because it goes against our principles of distributive justice, preferential justice for the poor, principles of accountability, which basically means failure to take care of our God-given resources. Swedish researcher for the SwedWatch organisation, Therese Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m, said they carried out research on how Swedish companies actions in other countries impacted on human rights and the environment. We looked at the weaknesses of the Kimberley Process, which is meant to be a sustainability certification for diamonds globally, but it s not working because it does not consider human rights or working conditions, she said.Lawrence Mwanangombe, from Zambia, complained that the Zambian government had not adequately addressed the issue of leasing too much land to mining companies. He said streams were polluted by the mines emissions, which impacted adversely on the health of locals.
