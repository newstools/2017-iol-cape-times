Former SABC executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng claims he was prejudiced during a parliamentary inquiry into the affairs of the broadcaster, it emerged on Tuesday.Parliament s ad hoc committee conducting the probe met to discuss a summary of submissions it received on its damning draft report. In the summary, it s noted that Motsoeneng s legal representative wanted it placed on record that his client never had the opportunity to appear before the committee and was therefore prejudiced.MPs are set to reject this argument as the SABC was given ample opportunity during the inquiry to present its case or cross-examine witnesses. Earlier this year, the committee also rejected a call by United Democratic Movement MP Nqabayomzi Kwankwa that Motsoeneng be called to testify given the barrage of negative testimony against him.The committee is set to send a letter to Motsoeneng s lawyer denying any bias towards their client.
