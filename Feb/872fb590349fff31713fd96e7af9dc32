An armed tavern drinker who snapped when a troublemaker took his drink to provoke him was effectively jailed for 12 years yesterday for shooting the man dead.Mthuthezi Mfobo appeared in the Parow Regional Court before magistrate Constance Nziweni, who also declared him unfit to possess a firearm. Mfobo faced a minimum sentence of 15 years for murder for premeditated murder, the minimum is life imprisonment, but this was not premeditated.However, because Mfobo pleaded guilty and apologised in court to Christopher Nkonyana s family, prosecutor Barry van der Berg said the circumstances did not justify 15 years imprisonment. The incident happened at the Styles Tavern in Langa in April.The court heard that Mfobo s brother had died several years ago, but that he had only found out about it two years later.Evidence was that Nkonyana enjoyed taunting Mfobo about the fact that he had only found out about his brother s death years after it happened. Mfobo resented it and he snapped when Nkonyanawalked into the tavern and took his drink.The magistrate told Mfobo: Had it not been for the deceased s conduct, you would not be before this court, today. But Nziweni said society had enough of the violence plaguing the country, in which innocent people die like flies .Society would not demand that Mfobo be sacrificed on the altar , and it was unlikely that he would ever do this again , she said.Nziweni said Mfobo had pleaded guilty, and by doing so had not wasted the court s time.She said he had taken full responsibility for his conduct, and had apologised to Nkonyana s family, to the court as well as to society.This had reduced his moral blameworthiness, and Nziweni sensed that his apology was sincere and that he was not just paying lip service.She said Mfobo had shot Nkonyana in the head and that society expected the court to punish him appropriately.Mfobo was sentenced to 15 years jail, of which three were conditionally suspended for five years.The magistrate added: This is not the end of the road for you and, even though you pleaded guilty, you may still appeal the sentence, provided you lodge an application for permission to appeal within 14 days.
