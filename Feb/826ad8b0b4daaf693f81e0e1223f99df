The Treasury yesterday denied reports of a potential conflict between Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini. National Treasury needs to put it on record that its involvement in the matter of the payment of grants beyond March 31, 2017 was at the behest of the Department of Social Department (DSD) and Sassa, the Treasury said in a statement. Accordingly, National Treasury explored and analysed the pros and cons of a range of payment options and provided expert inputs in areas of procurement, public finance, financial sector policy, banking and other related matters. However, it is up to Sassa as to which option to choose, taking into account all relevant facts, laws and regulations. This includes the relevant decision of the courts in the same matter. National Treasury is happy that the DSD has committed to seek the view of the Constitutional Court insofar as the option it prefers is concerned on which the court has previously made a determination.
