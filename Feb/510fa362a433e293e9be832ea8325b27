The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse yesterday lauded the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) for rejecting Eskom s demands for a higher tariff increase.The alliance also heaped praise on Nersa for sticking to the 2.2% allowed under the current multi-year price determination (MYPD) process, saying it had it on good authority that Eskom s lack of robust internal auditing processes had led to billions of rand being lost to corruption. We are appalled that Eskom has cited current hardships as the reason for requesting a much higher increase, especially since these so-called hardships are self-inflicted as reflected in the recent Dentons Report, said the NGO s energy portfolio director Ted Blom.It did, however, disagree with Nersa s comment that a 2.2% increase made Eskom unsustainable, as it believed this would force Eskom to seek internal efficiencies. Eskom s leadership must change its mindset and realise that it cannot continue to pass its poor productivity, maladministration, expensive contracts and billions lost to corruption on to the public through tariff hikes, Blom said.The damning evidence contained in the sanitised Dentons Report released last week confirmed that Eskom s leadership had not deserved a cent of the bonuses received in recent years. We believe an independent and detailed commission of inquiry is long overdue, and will reveal damning evidence of looting, organised crime and institutionalised fraud within Eskom, he said.The under-recovery of poorly planned and over-zealous revenue targets should not become the consumers problem. The people of South Africa were not Eskom s piggy-bank to tap into each time Eskom got its forecasts and overspending wrong. Public Enterprises Minister Lynn Brown and Nersa should stand firm in forcing Eskom to get its house in order and cease the repetitive waste. We have it on good authority that Eskom s lack of robust internal auditing processes has given rise to billions of rand lost to corruption, Blom said.According to media reports, the long-awaited Dentons Report on Eskom sheds light on shocking financial abuses.
