FIRES along the Bains Kloof Pass had not yet been completely contained, said Cape Winelands fire chief Danie Wilds yesterday afternoon. The fire is not contained yet. There s always the danger and possibility of reigniting, depending on the winds which will determine whether they spread, said Wilds.He said that poor vegetation management in the plantations next to Bainskloof Pass complicated the efforts of firefighters, who would continue to contain the fire line. That s the situation, basically. In summer there are always quite a lot of small fires in the Cape Winelands area. There are smaller fires every day. There had been no injuries, or structural damage, except for a little damage to vineyards, said Wilds, who added that the cost of the firefighting had not yet been determined. But for the Winelands, already over R1 million for aerial resources and ground-fighting teams has been spent. We are using our own firefighting teams and the Cape Nature firefighters, he added. He said 91 firefighters were being deployed, with six firefighting vehicles on standby for possible flare-ups.The 28.8km Bains Kloof Pass stretches from the bridge over the Breede River to the outskirts of Wellington on the R301, linking the town to Ceres and Worcester. The road has been open since Monday.
