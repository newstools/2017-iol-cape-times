Universities in the province are raising funds to run their institutions smoothly this academic year following losses to violent demonstrations during the Fees Must Fall protests.The cost of destruction to property was R600million at the end of last year, and matriculants are worried about securing places.At Stellenbosch University 5 399 students registered from 22 500 applications.UCT received 26 416 applications from first year students, and the institution can enrol only 4 200.UWC welcomed about 4 200 students as well, and received nearly 30 000 applications.Stellenbosch University spokesperson Martin Viljoen said the university was raising funds for various bursaries, and donations from individuals and funds from national companies and foundations had increased. Universities are applying various measures to generate new income and to save on expenses. &quot;Existing measures include, inter alia, offering more short courses, extending online platforms for studying and increasing income from contract research. &quot;A bigger emphasis is placed on alternative sources of income as such as commercialising intellectual property and generating income from products carrying our trademark, eg through the Matie Shop and providing residence accommodation to members of the public during the long university recess periods, Viljoen said.UWC spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo said the 8% increase affected less than 20% of students, and the majority would be covered by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme and the missing middle government subsidy. The university is fundraising for infrastructure projects to improve the resources and offering that will benefit our students, Tyhalibongo said.UCT says government grants over the last two decades have not kept pace with the enrolment numbers in higher education.
