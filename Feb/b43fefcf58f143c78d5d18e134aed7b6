The Gauteng Department of Community Safety has confirmed that some of its provincial traffic police would be part of President Jacob Zuma s entourage ahead of the State of the Nation address.The confirmation came after the local DA leader, John Moodey, said his party in Gauteng had been reliably informed that the Gauteng Provincial Traffic Police had sent more than 20 officers and 18 motorbikes to strengthen the state authority presence at the Sona. This comes at a time in which President Jacob Zuma has requested 441 SANDF officers to assist in maintaining 'law and order'. It begs the question as to why these provincial traffic police, which should be serving on Gauteng s many freeways, have been moved out of the province to assist with the Sona, Moodey said.He said the Western Cape and the City of Cape Town were fully capacitated to manage the Sona with their provincial traffic police and metro police officers. Gauteng Premier David Makhura must explain this sudden and bizarre move, which is not only a waste of valuable public money but denies residents the safety and security they are entitled to on our provincial roads. Once again, Premier Makhura has shown himself to be no more than a servant of Luthuli House and not one to the people of Gauteng, Moodey said.However, Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane said her office had received a request from the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) to assist with the provision of bikers for the Sona.She said the RTMC had asked for nine traffic officers and nine bikers as well as their supervisor. We accepted the request of the RTMC, which is an agent of the national Department of Transport. The number of officers sent is 10 and one of them is a supervisor. We also sent nine bikes as per the request of the RTMC.&quot;
