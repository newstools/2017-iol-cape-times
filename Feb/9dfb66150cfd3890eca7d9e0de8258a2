Another South African man has been killed in Syria. The 25-year-old from Port Elizabeth was apparently friends with the Durban man who was found dead in the same country earlier this week.While the details surrounding the deaths of both men are still sketchy, it is understood that the Durban man is the son of a religious leader and he and his brother were fighting with the Mujahedeen, a Syrian militant group formed to fight Islamic State.The news was broken by social activist Yusuf Abramjee, who told The Star he was yet to receive further details on both deaths. Nelson Kgwete, of the Department of International Relations and Co-operation, said the government was yet to receive the information officially. So far, all we ve heard is through media reports. But our people on the ground are looking into the matter and are yet to report back to us with any concrete information, Kgwete said. Meanwhile, Joburg-based photojournalist Shiraaz Mohamed has been missing in Syria for over a month now. There is still little information with regard to Mohamed s whereabouts while there have been several attempts to find him. Mohamed was captured on January 10 by a group of men who said they wanted to clear up a misunderstanding with him. He was taken outside a Gift of the Givers hospital. The charity organisation was responsible for helping him get into the country. According to the organisation s founder, Imtiaz Sooliman, Mohamed was to help the organisation document its work through his photographs in Syria.
