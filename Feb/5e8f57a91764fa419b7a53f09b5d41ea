EFF leader Julius Malema accused the ANC of being hypocrites when it failed to vote in favour of the scrapping of the property clause in the constitution to allow for land expropriation without compensation.After his party lost the vote in Parliament yesterday, Malema said the ANC had never meant what it has been saying about radical economic transformation.His party tabled a motion calling for the scrapping of the clause, calling for expropriation without compensation.The party said the property clause protected private property rights and made it impossible for the dispossessed to get justice. You never mean anything you say. You stand up and say you fight corruption and you bring corruption into Parliament in the name of Brian Molefe, he said. We are not to be told what to do. We are not in alliance with anyone else, the ANC s Phumuzile Ngwenya-Mabila said. We agree that the land reform process is slow (but)&quot; we disagree with the motion by (the EFF's Floyd) Shivambu, she said. Expropriation without compensation is unconstitutional. We need to respect and uphold the constitution of this country, Ngwenya-Mabila said.
