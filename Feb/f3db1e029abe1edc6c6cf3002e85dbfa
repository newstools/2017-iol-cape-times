The Gauteng Department of Health has called on the Shammah House NGO to engage directly with the family of a man who complained that his mentally ill brother had died in their care, and not through their legal representatives. The DA said yesterday it had reported an NGO for threatening to take legal action against a man who complained that his 60-year-old mentally ill brother had died in their care, allegedly because of poor treatment. Gauteng health spokesperson Prince Hamnca said: The department saw the letter and we felt that it was heavy-handed. It was not proper to speak to bereaved families in that manner. We encourage the facility to engage with the family directly. DA MPL Jack Bloom said he was appalled that Shammah House had threatened the brother of a deceased psychiatric patient who was sent there from Life Esidimeni last year. Mike Tlholwe died at Shammah House in Cullinan on February 12, shortly before an ambulance was to take him to hospital. Bloom said on Thursday that a law firm representing Shammah House had sent a letter to the deceased s brother, Ike Tlholwe, threatening him with legal action if he did not retract public statements blaming the NGO for his brother s poor treatment. Part of the letter said: Our instructions are that our client attended to your brother s health and welfare according to best practice and followed every relevant protocol. Our client reserves its rights to take any legal action should they become aware of any untrue, unfounded or defamatory statements or insinuations in respect of their conduct. Bloom said Shammah House was acting in an inappropriate and insensitive manner. I have reported this to Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa and requested her to intervene to resolve this matter. Shammah House could not be reached for comment. African News Agency
