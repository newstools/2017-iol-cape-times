ELDERLY tenants at Communicare s Welverdiend complex in Rondebosch are angry at the management s scrapping of a security guard system at the residence gate. They now have to open it with their cellphones.Tenants claim the cellphone-controlled access system is dangerous for the elderly and the security guard control system was safer. What we need is visible security (guard) at the gate, said Welverdiend Community Forum member Raymond Abrahams, who with Ronald Roode highlighted the elderly residents' frustrations. They took away the gate security guard without agreement from us residents.&quot; Abrahams said tenants had signed a petition against the new system and gave it to management. Roode lamented that elderly tenants had to buy cellphones which they didn t need, because they had landlines which were easier to use.Abrahams revealed that during a month-long trial in August, and when the system was launched in September, elderly tenants had struggled to open the gates. It was a case of not knowing how to use cellphones, because we have residents of over 70, 80 and 90 years old. Sometimes they can t open the gates themselves, which forces them to stand and wait until someone who can assist comes along. There had been an incident when a tenant was stabbed when his cellphone was grabbed. Another problem is that tenants have to use their last pension monies to buy airtime to open the gate, added Abrahams. So when some of us run out of airtime it means you have no access, exposing you to criminal elements. The complex's portfolio manager did not respond to queries yesterday.
