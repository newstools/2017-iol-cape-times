Interpol ambassador Andy Mashaile says the murder case of former Bafana Bafana skipper Senzo Meyiwa should be moved to the Hawks for priority investigation.Mashaile was speaking to The Sunday Independent this week, expressing shock that those in the house when Meyiwa was gunned down could not properly identify the suspects. Something is not right here. I would strongly advise that the Hawks take over this case and use other tactics or strategy to arrive at a resolution for this case, he said.Mashaile said it was understandable why people like Meyiwa s father, Sam, who lost their loved ones to crime, would lose trust in the police for failing to resolve his son s murder.This week Statistician-General Pali Lehohla released the victims of crime report which stated that many people did not want to report crimes to the police because of lack of trust. People don t trust the police because of the few individual police officers who are not giving feedback to the victims of crime, but the majority of them do, Mashaile said. I accept that there is lack of confidence in the police by the people because there is anger about brutal cases that remain unsolved. Meyiwa was killed on the night of October 26, 2014 at the family home of his girlfriend, Kelly Khumalo, in what has been described as a robbery gone wrong.Investigators are still appealing for the public to come forward with any information that could lead to the arrest of the perpetrator(s).They can contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or SMS Crime Line at 32211.The Sunday Independent
