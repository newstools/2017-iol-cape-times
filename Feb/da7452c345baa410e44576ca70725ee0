Western Cape Premier Helen Zille s State of the Province address got off to a shaky start as her attempts to hold a moment of silence for the deaths of the mentally challenged patients at the Life Esidemeni centre were shot down.&nbsp;Proceedings are currently under way at the Western Cape Provincial Legislature where the premier is addressing the first sitting of the House.&nbsp;In her opening address, Zille told the House she wanted to start off with a moment of silence for the 94 patients who died at Life Esidimeni last year.Objections from the House stated that such a request should come from the Speaker of the House and not the Premier. The Premier then withdrew her request.&nbsp;Last Thursday, during President Jacob Zuma s State of the Nation address, attempts by the Democratic Alliance to observe a moment of silence for the patients were also shot down by Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbethe.Political Bureau
