A week-long wage strike by members of the National Education Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) at Unisa has ended, the union said on Wednesday.The parties agreed to a wage hike of between 8 and 5 percent for employees across five salary scales, with the lowest paid receiving the highest salary increase and the highest paid receiving the minimum five percent increase.&quot;The agreed settlement also includes an 8 percent increase for housing allowance for workers on salary level P9 to P10. Both parties agreed that the new salary increases will be implemented on the 15 February this year,&quot; the union said in a statement.&quot;Our agreement with Unisa also includes the fact that the 'no work, no pay' principle will not apply, Unisa has instructed its legal team to cancel its courts process against striking workers.&quot;Union members downed tools at the institution last week after wage negotiations deadlocked at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). The strike impacted on the new academic year registrations as staff abandoned work for the picket lines.Nehawu had tabled a 16 percent salary increase, the employer offered an initial 6 percent, which was then lowered to 4.5. Intensive negotiations while the strike continued saw the parties coming to an agreement, which also covered temporary workers at the institution.&quot;Our members have returned with enthusiasm and vigour to work hard in resuming the academic calendar programme of 2017. In this regard, the union wishes to thank all members and workers in general of this institution for preserving unity amongst themselves, solidarity and showing commitment in pursuit of our call for decent wage project,&quot; the union said.
