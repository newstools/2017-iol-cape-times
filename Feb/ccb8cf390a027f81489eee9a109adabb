A key witness in the State's case against a Pietermaritzburg woman charged with murdering her four-month-old infant has gone missing.Thulile Myaka s trial in the high court in Durban was supposed to start earlier this month but was adjourned until yesterday because her ex-boyfriend and the father of her child whom she is also charged with attempting to kill was missing.When the matter came before court yesterday, public prosecutor Krishen Shah said the man had still not been found but a warrant for his arrest had been issued and that the State was confident they would locate him.Myaka, 32, allegedly threw a pot of boiling water on her baby girl, Anele, last August. Anele died in hospital four days later.The State alleges that on August 18, Myaka took Anele to Umbilo, in Durban, to see the baby's father and the two argued over money for baby formula. She allegedly took a pot of boiling water from the stove and threw it over both the baby and her father before fleeing.Anele and her father were both rushed to hospital. Anele died on August 22, due to complications from the burns.Myaka will be back in court late next month.
