Altnta wounded three others before being killed in a shootout.Jury member Tanya Habjouqa said of this year's winners: It was a very intense, sometimes brutal, discussion - sometimes even emotional - but I feel proud. I think we were brave in our decision. We were bold. I think the selection is definitely going to push forward a debate and I think it is a debate that is essential to have. - Staff Writer
