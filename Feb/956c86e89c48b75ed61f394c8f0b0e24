EARLY deadlines for school applications have been set to meet an increasing demand for those seeking enrolment.There are still 3 500 children who have not been placed at schools in the province for this academic year and, to accommodate children for next year, the provincial education department has announced March 24 as the deadline for applications.Education MEC Debbie Sch&auml;fer s spokesperson, Jessica Shelver, said the deadline applied particularly to children who were starting Grade 1 or Grade 8 and children who were changing schools.Parents had to apply before the end of the first term for next year, to enable schools to process applications during the second term, Shelver said. We urge parents to confirm acceptance by this deadline to avoid double parking , where learners are enrolled at more than one school. We cannot guarantee immediate placement for those who apply late, nor places at schools of choice for anybody. It is thus vital that parents apply at several schools, Shelver said.There are about 1 million pupils enrolled at schools across the province this year, and at the start of the academic year about 17 000 were not placed in schools.Shelver said curriculum and subject advisers would ensure catch-up programmes were available for pupils who had started the year late. Schools must inform parents of the outcome in writing of their applications by June 3. Parents have to confirm acceptance by the end of the second term, by Friday, June 30, she said.
