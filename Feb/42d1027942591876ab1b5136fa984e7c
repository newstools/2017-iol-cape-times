The enforcement of language rights, as a powerful lever to turn economic transformation from political rhetoric to reality, took centre stage during a ceremony to commemorate International Mother Language Day at Sandton City yesterday.This comes against the backdrop of shocking findings that the majority of national government and provincial departments do not have language policies, thereby denying millions of South Africans the opportunity to transact in the language of their choice.Government institutions are required to lead the way in promoting multilingualism and being vigilant against the dominance of some languages, such as English.Organised by the Pan South African Language Board (PanSALB), the event was attended by about 200 people government officials, academics, pupils and representatives of national language structures under the theme Towards sustainable futures through multilingual education&quot;.In an interview with The Star, PanSALB chief executive Dr Rakwena Monareng said: This is about celebrating our identity, which is inscribed in our mother language. This is part of our concerted efforts aimed at giving value to these languages by providing them with effective and strategic space for expression We are disappointed and dismayed that many government departments and institutions are not taking our constitution seriously, because the cause of language diversity is mandated by the constitution. Other participants noted that international platforms must be transformed to encourage diversity in the use of language. The UK and US were cited as dominant cultures with their use of English. One of the guests honoured for excelling in indigenous languages was Shihluke Mswanganye, who won R5 000 for being the best pupil in Xitsonga for 2016 in Grade 12.Meanwhile, Unesco director-general Irina Bokova used the occasion to appeal for a multi-stakeholder approach to language diversity.
