A group of lawyers and software developers wanted to find a 21st century way to connect people flying into the US from the countries affected by President Trump s contested travel ban with volunteer attorneys on the ground.And now, there s an app for that.AirportLawyer.org, a website whipped up by a team of programmers over the weekend while much of the US was watching the Super Bowl, can link travellers landing at US airports with free legal help to manoeuvre through whatever trouble they might find as they try to clear customs and border protection.The app, which went live on Monday, is being used by volunteer lawyers at airports including Baltimore-Washington International Marshall, Dulles International, Denver International and Seattle-Tacoma International, with other major airports expected to join.In the turbulent days since January 27, when Trump signed his executive order banning refugees and other travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries and before a federal judge issued a stay of the ban thousands of people have been detained or have run into trouble clearing customs at US airports.That has prompted volunteer lawyers to set up temporary shop at international-arrival terminals, working around the clock and waving placards announcing Free Lawyer . Most have no way of knowing who is arriving from countries affected by Trump s ban, except for information they gather in conversations with anxious family members nearby.That dilemma spurred Seattle lawyers Greg McLawsen, Takao Yamada and Tahmina Watson to team up with software developers to create a tech solution: an app.At AirportLawyer.org, travellers or their family members can upload personal information and travel plans, including arrival date, time and airport. That information is then securely shared with volunteer lawyers who can track the arrivals and meet the travellers. Those of us at the airport will know who s coming in, and we d be better prepared with information to work on their behalf, said Yamada, who has been volunteering his legal services at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.He is also a co-founder of a Seattle tech start-up.With the information that immigrants and other travellers provide through the website, volunteer lawyers may be better able to answer family members questions about why, for example, an immigrant whose flight landed at noon hadn t cleared customs screening five hours later.Trump s ban left thousands stranded around the world. On Friday, US District Judge James Robart reversed Trump s order, and the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit was set to hear arguments this week.A decision either way could shake things up once again, McLawsen said. We believe that through the rest of the week, while the stay is in place, people will be coming in, he said. If I were one of them, I d be jumping on a plane right now. While Judge Robart s order helped ease travel for many, lawyers say some clients still aren t being allowed to board aircraft overseas and are being detained for long stretches after arriving at US airports. Two of the scariest things for people waiting at the airport are not knowing what s going on with their loved ones, and if something is going on, not knowing what to do about it, Yamada said. We can help them find out and get them some help. The Washington Post
