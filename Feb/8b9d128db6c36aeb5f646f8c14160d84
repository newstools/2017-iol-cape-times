Controversial forensic consultant Paul O'Sullivan was arrested on Monday night allegedly on the same charge as his attorney, Sarah Jane Trent.Trent was taken into custody last week for allegedly impersonating an officer of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid).Afriforum CEO Kallie Kriel confirmed that O'Sullivan was arrested on the same charges after a meeting at their offices. O'Sullivan was arrested outside the office building and immediately taken to Kameeldrift police station.Kriel told The Star he was convinced the charges were trumped up, and said that an urgent application was set to take place at the North Gauteng High Court on Monday night to secure bail for O'Sullivan.Kriel was also insistent that O'Sullivan had been granted a court order in November that police would have to give the forensic consultant at least 48 hours notice if he were to be arrested, an order that was alleged ignored by the SAPS on Monday night.O'Sullivan came under fire by the Hawks at the weekend over a report where he alleged a large number of top officials were involved in criminal activities.
