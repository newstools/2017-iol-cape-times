The use of force against the EFF in Parliament turned the State of the Nation address into an assault on the nation reminiscent of the apartheid regime and President Jacob Zuma into the enemy of the people, DA leader Mmusi Maimane said yesterday.Borrowing from George Orwell to reflect on the brutality of the booted foot of one of Parliament s white-shirted security men kicking the face of female MPs, Maimane said the police, never mind scores of riot police, had no place in Parliament in a democracy. The liberator turned oppressor. The enemy of the people. In his novel 1984, George Orwell said: If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever , Maimane said. We saw a glimpse of this future on Thursday night, and it looked very much like our painful past. The police in riot gear. The deployment of the army. The screams of female members of Parliament as they were punched and kicked. A boot stamping on a human face. South Africa will never forget what happened on Thursday. On Zuma s chuckle as he began his speech after the EFF departure, he added: We will never forget the reaction of the man at the centre of it all. We will never forget how he laughed It was the laugh of the enemy of the people. Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti said economic radical transformation, a key pledge in the speech, was a policy long agreed by the ANC.United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa decried the current state of affairs. As we enter the 23rd year of our democracy, we see an increase in the politics of patronage, uncontrollable corruption, collapse of government institutions, high unemployment, lack of development, failing health and education systems, widening inequality, chronic poverty and ineffective provincial governments. He proposed that a national consultative conference, open to all, be held. ANA
