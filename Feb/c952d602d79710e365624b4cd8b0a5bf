Unless the City of Johannesburg addresses the massive influx of illegal churches springing up in Yeoville, residents have warned that the vigilante violence recently seen in Rosettenville could emerge in the densely populated suburb. The threat of xenophobic violence comes after certain churches in the area have encroached on residences and elicited noise complaints, and by-law enforcement from the city has yet to arrive. Yeoville residents have continued to express their fury, claiming the City of Joburg is unable to bring about law and order in addressing these issues. A Pastor Elijah has opened a church in a block of flats on Joe Slovo Drive, and the sound of constant band music is ruining neighbours lives. Neighbours claim they cannot sleep, that their children cannot study and their property values are being devalued.They further claim that they are verbally abused by the pastor and his congregation when they complain.Neighbour Satoko Mahlangu claims she is constantly harassed by the pastor and his people when she complains. Last week, after hearing the noise I went into the church, introduced myself and asked them to stop the noise. A few men grabbed my body and pushed me out. Later, the pastor came to my flat, screaming and shouting that I had trespassed on his property. He went to Yeoville police station to open a case against me. Reverend Tsepo Matubatuba, who represents Yeoville residents, said the matter of illegal churches was out of control.He, too, suffers from another illegal church in Francis Street which has been going for years.Matubatuba said neighbouring residents were threatened if they complained. I fear that if no decisive intervention is made, this could result in a sad situation, either an injury or death, he said. Situations like that can only end in disaster like Rosettenville, he said. It happens because people don t know what else to do because they are not being helped by the authorities. It s going to be very ugly.
