BACKYARD dwellers in Khayelitsha s Makhaza have clashed with police and the City s law enforcement officers, demanding they be allowed to occupy two pieces of vacant land which belongs to the City.Police and the City s anti-land invasion unit faced-off against about 200 residents from Makhaza, resulting in rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades being used to disperse the backyarders who at the weekend erected their shacks, while some demarcated plots with wooden pegs.Backyarder Thembile Yekwa said a community meeting on Saturday morning resolved that the land should be invaded. Renting in a backyard is too much, said Yekwa, adding that of the R1 000 he earns a month he pays R400 for rent. This piece of land has been vacant for decades. We are not the first people to have erected shacks on open land. Where are we expected to stay with our big families? asked Yekwa. Another backyarder, Nkosini Mbele, said he would continue erecting his shack on the land. If it means I must die or (be) arrested for seeking a basic right entrenched in the constitution then let it be, he said. Mbele said there was a meeting planned for Friday where the backyarders would be encouraged to erect their shacks. The slow pace of the government to build decent houses for people is tiring, he said. Eastern suburbs mini-mayor Anda Ntsondo said the land in Makhaza was illegally invaded. He said the invaders were aware of the channels they were supposed to follow to access subsidised-housing opportunities. Their actions are totally unjustifiable. Gone are the days for actions such as this. The doors are open for constructive engagement, said Ntsondo. He said nobody was allowed to occupy land without consent of the owner, which in this case is the City. Ntsondo said the City would be engaging with the backyarders to investigate the reasons behind the invasion of the land, and to explain the challenges created by this kind of action.
