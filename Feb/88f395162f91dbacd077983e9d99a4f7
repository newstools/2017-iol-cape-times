A GROUP of residents from Woodstock who applied to the Western Cape High Court to block their removal to an incremental development area, 35km away from their current homes in Bromwell Street, will have to wait a while longer for judgment in the case against the City of Cape Town.The city had planned to relocate 27 residents to Wolverivier, near Melkbosstrand. But Bromwell Street residents, facing eviction from their homes after it was bought by property developers, have rejected this offer, saying the area was far from amenities.Residents applied to the court to declare that the City had a constitutional duty to provide them and their dependants with temporary emergency accommodation as near as possible to where they lived. This situation doesn t seem to be immediately remediable. There is an obligation on the municipality to provide temporary emergency housing, and you re telling me that in order to bring justice, I must reject Wolwerivier and carry on suspending the eviction order while they re allowed to squat there, said Acting Judge Leslie Weinkove.The Woodstock Hub bought the Bromwell Street houses in 2013, instituted eviction proceedings in July 2015 and, according to court papers, the company wanted to construct middle income units for rent between R5 000 and R9 000 a month.Advocate Sheldon Magardie, for the residents, told the court that Cape Town was unique in that it was one of the most historically spatially divided cities in the country, and also in the midst of one of the worst housing affordability crises in the world. The City was required to have regard for the relationship between the residents places of employment, their children s schooling and their access to health-care facilities when deciding whether Wolwerivier was a reasonable and appropriate location, said Magardie.The City argued that it had offered the residents housing which complied with the requirements imposed by the constitution and the National Housing Code; and that Wolwerivier was the closest location for temporary emergency accommodation.Advocate Karrisha Pillay, for the City, told the court that if residents wanted land for housing closer to Wolwerivier, it was the national government s prerogative to release land. The residents can t compel the City to do so (release land closest to Bromwell Street), they have a constitutional right to choose where they want to live, Pillay said.The representative for Woodstock Hub, Ross Randall, told the court his clients were suffering prejudice by court proceedings, and were paying R50 000 a month for property they could not use. Randall argued that the resident s rights could not trump those of the landowners. We know that no one will be left homeless as the city has offered the residents a place to stay at a location they said is the closest. The landlord suffers a loss every month, Randall argued.Judgment has been reserved. [email&#160;protected]
