SSC s Abdi Alas Gure said Somalis feel like they are under attack and traders are too scared to step outside their shops.He said the motive for the killings is unclear, but it is a big concern for us all . Gure also reportedly said that it appeared that their brothers , who owned businesses in the townships, were being victimised, and that six shopkeepers had been murdered in Khayelitsha Site C, one in Makhaya and two in Philippi.He said Gugulethu was another area where they had been receiving many complaints of shopkeepers targeted.Gure said that there had been a spate of Somali business robberies, but that the police could not confirm this due to a moratorium on crime stats.Police spokesperson Andr&eacute; Traut said the most common motive for murders on Somali nationals in the Khayelitsha area was robbery. Murders and business robberies are high on the priority list for the police in the Khayelitsha Cluster... Before all shops used to be targeted including those owned by locals, but now it s only Somali shops that are being attacked, Traut said.Meanwhile, in Bonteheuwel Cheslyn Lawrence, 34, was shot dead in Geelhout street yesterday. Police said three others were shot dead in the early hours of Sunday morning.Police have urged people with information about the killings to call Crime Stop at 08600 10111. [email&#160;protected]
