Ahead of the anniversary of his death, the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania held a banquet in honour of its founding father, Robert Sobukwe, in Langa at the weekend.Several PAC luminaries attended the event, where one of the party s stalwarts, Professor Sipho Shabalala, was the main speaker. He stuck rigidly to the party s old prescriptions for South Africa in his message to the faithful.Shabalala touched on the current political climate in South Africa, and the possibility of a change in government come 2019.While the ANC faced the possibility of electoral defeat, Shabalala said a new political and governance structure supportive of substantive democracy must replace the existing dispensation . The prevailing entrenched social order in this country is promoting strife, low-key incessant revolt and festering instability. Under these conditions everyone is badly affected: worse of course are the poor and the wretched of the Earth, said Shabalala.
