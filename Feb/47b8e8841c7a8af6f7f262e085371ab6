Two days after a new interim leader took charge of the DA in the Western Cape, one of Patricia de Lille s top lieutenants suddenly quit the provincial legislature.In his resignation letter, Rodney Lentit, who had been chairperson of the DA s caucus in the legislature, referred in his resignation letter to De Lille as his political mother .Earlier this month De Lille suddenly relinquished her position as DA provincial leader. This came soon after another of her close allies, DA Cape Metro chair Shaun August, alongside City of Cape Town councillor Matthew Kempthorne, were found guilty by the party for not following procurement rules when T-shirts were acquired ahead of last year s local government elections.In his resignation letter, Lentit said: After careful thought and consideration, I have concluded that my time at the provincial parliament has come to an end. I have been offered an opportunity that I believe will help me reach my long-term career and family goals. Called for comment, he said he would remain a member of the DA, and would help the party towards the 2019 general elections, but that his focus would now be on the retail and property development sector where he had worked prior to his foray into politics in 2003.
