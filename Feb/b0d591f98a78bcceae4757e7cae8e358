Prison officials, including warders and administrators, protested at Drakenstein Correctional Centre yesterday to vent their frustrations over their working conditions, citing discrimination from a senior official in the management area.About 100 officials participated in the protest, leaving the inmates unattended for most of the day. Protesters complained that the senior official had discriminated against the black officials and had failed to implement the department s employment equ- ity plan.Carrying placards denouncing racism, the protesters said they would continue protesting until the official or the provincial management addressed them and assured their grievances would be addressed. While the protest was being staged at the entrance of the facility, senior managers were engaging workers representatives in a closed meeting. Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union provincial chairperson Mncedisi Mbolekwa said grievances dated to 2015 and accused the senior official of victimising his black subordinates by treating them like animals and using vulgar language when addressing them. He said the official should be investigated and suspended. We cannot allow racism to go on in a historic centre where president Nelson Mandela was kept. Mbolekwa said the senior official was manipulating the recruitment process to advance coloured members in the Drakenstein management area. A warder, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of victimisation, said: This discrimination is serious and has been happening for years. Correctional Services regional commissioner Delekile Klaas acknowledged he had received a memorandum from the officials in November and again yesterday, and was attending to their grievances.
