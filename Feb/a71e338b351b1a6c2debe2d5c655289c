Booming bass, crystalline electronica, furious techno and sublime lyrics all formed part of the dazzling display flaunted in the Cape Town City Hall at the weekend as music lovers flocked to the venue to experience their favourite artists in action at the Red Bull Cape Town Electronic Music Festival (CTEMF). The historic hall, built in 1905 to house the City of Cape Town s offices, came alive with eye-catching laser lights and graphics which provided the backdrop to the main stage.Here in The Audiotorium the audience was treated to the arresting sounds of DJ s X-Ray, Yeti, Stab Virus, Mateo and techno titan Dave Clarke.CTEMF media liaison officer Heather Mennell said the festival evolves and mutates every year. 2017 was no exception with the number of dance floors being expanded to five - to include a new Mezzanine Stage and a variety of chill areas, food options and bars. It s easy to spend your time at festivals tailing big name artists, but a big part of CTEMF s charm is its support for homegrown heroes and the next generation of stars, Mennell said. She said day one on The Mezzanine and Club Stages exemplified this philosophy and featured strictly Capetonian line-ups. Standout sets on the Mezzanine Stage came from K-$, Desert_Head and Hessien+. The outdoor Terrace Stage gave Cape Town duo Gin &amp; Chronic a platform to tease the dance floor to life with bright, bassy house cuts. DJ Invisable lifted the tempo with his frenetic dance moves and delirious, euphoric tunes and was followed by the techno sounds of Airwalker and Berlin s Re.You.On Saturday night the highlight of the event was rapper YoungstaCPT, who stirred the crowd to life with his clever lyrics and thumping basslines.YoungstaCPT, who hails from Wynberg, interacted with the audience, bringing out their exuberance with popular tracks like I Don t Know and Top Ten List.He left the crowd jumping up and down and whistling with their hands up in the air.Speaking to the Cape Times after his show on Saturday night, YoungstaCPT said he aimed to uplift the youth, the Y-Generation , and highlight the difficulties they face with drugs and crimes, and honour artists who manage to stay humble and on the right track despite the highs and lows.
