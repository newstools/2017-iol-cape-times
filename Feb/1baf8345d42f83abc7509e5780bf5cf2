Jessica Mbangeni is one of the most sought-after female praise-singers in the country.Tonight she will perform in front of parliamentarians at the gala dinner after President Jacob Zuma gives the annual State of the Nation Address in Cape Town. It s a God-given talent that I had to embrace. I have been doing it for the past 16 years and I ve learnt a lot through it, she said.In the past week, Mbangeni has done praises for the Xhosa king and former AU Commission head Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. I write relevant to the conditions we are in, sometimes it s controversial, but I reflect on what is happening in our country, she said.She is inspired by Prophet Ntsikana, a Christian poet, who prophesied about colonialism. Mbangeni believes praise-singing plays a vital role in the country. In all institutions we begin proceedings by saying something, and there is always someone who has to pray. Praise-singing is all about touching the core of the ancestors, she said.She added it was important to have confidence when standing up in front of people, and that this was when people had a connection with God.Mbangeni, who was born in the Eastern Cape, credits Zolani Mkiva as one of the people who helped elevate praise poetry in society.Praise poetry is male-dominated but Mbangeni has managed to solidify her place in it.Her range as an artist extends to acting as well. She has played roles in Soul City and Emzini Wezinsizwa and performed in festivals around the world.She released her debut album, IGoli, in 2012.Mbangeni, who believes praise-singing should be a module in African study, said those in praise poetry needed to understand their role and to take this gift forward . @mane_mpi
