The Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) on Thursday warned that the persistent rains could result in dangerous conditions which could affect communities.While it was still raining in some parts of South Africa post the departure of cyclone Dineo, Cogta warned the accumulative effect of these rains might have undesirable consequences like flash flooding caused by overflowing rivers, small and large dams.The South African Weather Service (SAWS) indicated last week that the fresh weather system was developing and it was going to bring rains over a number of provinces in our country such as Gauteng, North West, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State and some parts of the Northern Cape and the Eastern Cape.In North West three people were this week reported dead. In Leporung, near Makgobistad, a primary schoolboy drowned while attempting to cross a stream, and in Lemenong, Phokeng, two people drowned after their vehicle was swept away by overflows.In a statement issued by the Government Communications), Cogta said: At this stage our teams across the country are on alert, able to cope with the situation and they will do everything possible to assist communities, but we urge everyone to be extremely vigilant and cautious so that we can save lives. Communities under threat or exposed to the flooding risks are urged to go to higher ground when flash flood warnings are issued. These responses should happen as quickly as possible as conditions have the potential to deteriorate faster in such conditions, said Cogta.A comprehensive list of life-saving strategies can be found at: www.daff.gov.za and www.agis.agric.za African News Agency
