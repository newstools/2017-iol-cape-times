Nearly 16 000 pupils have been vaccinated against measles since an outbreak was declared in the Cape Winelands this month.There has been nine confirmed cases of measles, and the provincial health department has adopted the World Health Organisation s (WHO) Outbreak Response Protocol, which advises mass vaccination in the affected areas and surrounds. In a statement the department said about 15 500 pupils and children younger than five in affected areas in Stellenbosch in the Drakenstein had been vaccinated.Staff were sent to these areas, visiting schools, cr&egrave;ches and going door to door to vaccinate an average of 1 230 children a day. A target of 80% coverage was set by the department, and by yesterday 78% had been reached.According to the WHO, measles is one of the leading causes of death among young children, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo said: I want to thank the many role-players involved in the outbreak response, these include colleagues at education and private health providers and behind the scenes health staff, for their role in reaching our goal of 80 percent.&quot;Parents and caregivers have been advised to follow through with routine vaccinations and evaluations. Please keep your child s Road to Health booklet handy and remember to take it with you when you visit the clinic or health-care provider.&quot;Parents can also send the booklet to the cr&egrave;che, so that the health teams can note the measles booster shot in it, the department said.
