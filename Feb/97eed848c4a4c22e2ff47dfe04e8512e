He was treated for non-fatal drowning symptoms and hypothermia, Zimmerman said. A group of at least 30 Canadians in their teens and early twenties, students on a tour, were at the beach after arriving at Cape Point in a tour bus and some had gone swimming and body-boarding at Dias Beach. The 18-year-old was swept out to sea by rip currents and a fellow Canadian female, aged in the same age group, also part of the tour group, launched a body-board to go to his aid, paddling about 100 metres out to sea. She reached him and managed to assist the teenager to get back to the beach. She is commended for the rescue.
