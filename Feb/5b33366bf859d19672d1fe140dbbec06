Mayor Patricia de Lille and DA chief whip in the metro Shaun August have denied claims that they had a hand in leaking confidential party documents to the media.They received notices to face a possible disciplinary hearing.They, as well as former policy and strategy researcher in De Lille s office, Josh Jordaan, are being investigated by the DA s Federal Legal Commission for allegedly knowing that falsified documentation would be publicised.Last month, August and councillor Matthew Kempthorne were found guilty of not following procurement rules, after they bought party T-shirts ahead of the 2016 local government election campaign without following proper legal processes.An agreement and sentence of suspended membership for five years, and one month s salary, was agreed upon.De Lille has since resigned as the DA s Western Cape leader, and party members are expected to elect an acting leader at the provincial council in Worcester this weekend.But a DA insider, and supporter of De Lille, said reports yesterday that she faced possible expulsion was part of a smear campaign by those inside the DA caucus wanting to prevent August from becoming the party s interim provincial leader. He s currently ahead, and this story came out to sway the race in favour of Helen Zille s preferred candidate (Bonginkosi Madikizela), said the insider.Jordaan, who has already resigned, was accused of sending doctored admission of guilt documents to the media, with the knowledge of August and De Lille. August yesterday denied all allegations.De Lille denied that she faced expulsion but acknowledged that a disciplinary process had been started against her, referring the Cape Times to an earlier statement by federal executive chairperson James Selfe.Selfe said the leak violated the DA s confidentiality policy. The DA s Western Cape provincial executive committee has referred the leak of confidential party documentation to the media to me for consideration, as the chairperson of the DA s Federal Executive. I have accordingly referred the matter to the DA s Federal legal commission for investigation, in particular to determine the role played in the matter by Shaun August, Patricia de Lille and Josh Jordaan. There has been no suspension of any person, Selfe said yesterday. [email&#160;protected]
