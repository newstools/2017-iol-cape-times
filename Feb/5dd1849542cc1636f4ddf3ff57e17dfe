She revealed that his heart was being donated to a patient in Cape Town. Today I said goodbye to the love of my life, best friend and soulmate. I m so glad I got to hold you and kiss you one last time. Ludi was declared brain dead after being brutally attacked. He was kept alive on life support so that he can donate all of his organs, with the first being his heart going straight to a patient in Cape Town. I don t know how I ll do this without you. I love you and I m yours forever, she said. Ludi s mother, Danlee Vink, took to Facebook, saying: My heart is ripped out, my soul in pain. My darling, beautiful, kind son, Ludi Vink.
