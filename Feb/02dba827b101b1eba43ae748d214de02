The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has cautioned job seekers about an e-mail scam offering bogus employment.In a statement issued yesterday, Sars said an e-mail with its branding was doing the rounds confirming acceptance of the recipient into a Sars Leadership Programme . The prospective applicant is then instructed to make a deposit of an administrative fee into a Shoprite Money Market Service account for the application to be processed. The revenue service said the scam was similar to another one in which people impersonating Sars staffers informed people they had been given jobs, but had to buy uniforms and identity cards first. Members of the public are reminded that Sars will never ask that a payment be made into any other account. Anyone receiving suspicious e-mails claiming to be from Sars can contact the Sars fraud and anti-corruption hotline on 0800 00 287.&nbsp; African News Agency
