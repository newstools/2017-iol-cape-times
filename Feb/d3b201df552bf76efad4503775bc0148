Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane has denied allegations levelled at her by the EFF, which suggest she may have allowed a certain individual with whom she has a personal relationship to influence department programmes, procurement processes and spending.On Wednesday the EFF posted on Twitter the letter it sent to Mokonyane, a member of the national executive committee of the ANC. In the letter the EFF asks the minister questions related to the named individual and whether he has any influence over her department.Responding to the allegations, Mokonyane s office said in a statement late on Wednesday night: The office of the Minister of Water and Sanitation, Nomvula Mokonyane, yesterday received a letter from the chief whip of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Mr Floyd Shivambu, which has subsequently been leaked via social media to the public and to the media .The minister's office said the letter implied that a certain individual, with a close relationship with the minister, is influencing departmental programmes, procurement processes and spending; and that the minister is the owner of a certain property worth R40 million in the suburb of Sandhurst, Johannesburg .Sandhurst is probably the most expensive suburb in Johannesburg.The EFF also asks in its letter if Mokonyane knows the said individual and if she has a personal relationship with him that allegedly enables him to influence the goings-on in her department.Responding to the questions Mokonyane s office said: The minister has formally responded to the chief whip of the EFF and for public record wishes to state the individual referred to is neither in the employ of the department or any of its entities and as such is in no way involved in the operational and decision-making processes of the department. Equally, the minister has declared all her assets and interests including properties as required by the Register of Members Interests and owns no such a property. The allegations, as implied are aimed at tarnishing the name and good image of the minister with an intention to distract her from her responsibilities for nefarious political ends. Mokonyane s office said the minister rejects the allegations as unfounded, without factual basis . African News Agency
