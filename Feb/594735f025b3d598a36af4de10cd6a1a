DA leader Mmusi Maimane took the fight over the Life Esidimeni tragedy to Gauteng Premier David Makhura s doorstep when he led a protest march calling on the ANC provincial deputy chairperson to resign.During his State of the Province address (Sopa) last Monday, Makhura said his office had not played any role in the deaths of more than 100 mentally ill patients who died after being transferred from Life Esidimeni to various NGOs across the province. On Tuesday, the DA supporters protested outside Makhura s offices at 30 Simmonds Street in Joburg, calling for his resignation. DA councillor Jack Bloom received loud applause when he said: The province needs a new leadership that cares for the people. Makhura you have failed us. You must go. Maimane laid the blame for the deaths squarely at the ANC door, saying the ruling party should vote out Makhura, when the DA s no confidence motion against him is tabled at the Gauteng Provincial legislature on Tuesday. If they did not, all the ANC councillors would have blood on their hands.He called for a judicial commission of inquiry over the deaths, and for the victims families to be compensated.
