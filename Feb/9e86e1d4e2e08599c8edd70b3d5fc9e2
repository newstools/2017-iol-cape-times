We know that for Joost s sake, you will give them the space that they need and we thank you for that! Vittone wrote. Personally Joost gave me the greatest gift of my life because he was the father of my children. Even though we were separated, he was in our life on a daily basis right to the end and we shared extraordinary memories.
