Thousands gathered at the Grand Parade for the ANC People s Assembly, coinciding with President Jacob Zuma s State of the Nation address yesterday.Party supporters gathered from early on at the public square to show their support for Zuma. Speaking shortly after his address, Zuma accused opposition parties of going there with the express intention of disrupting his speech.Zuma thanked the party s supporters. We have taken a decision to observe and celebrate one of our outstanding comrades, president Oliver Tambo this year. If he was still alive, he d be 100, said Zuma.The ANC had estimated that 30 000 of its supporters would be present to show their approval and reaffirm their support for Zuma.They were entertained with live music as some of South Africa s best traditional music stars graced the stage.Supporters were also given a taste of the Cape as the Shoprite Pensylvanians, a klopse troupe from Wetton, performed. Sylvia Grootboom and her family came all the way from Klipheuwel, which is outside Malmesbury, to show their support for the ANC and Zuma. It was a long bus ride, but we are so happy to be here. We are supporting our party and our leader, the president, said Grootboom.Young supporters came into conflict with police as they attempted to enter Adderley Street, where EFF supporters were protesting in front of that party s Western Cape office.Police successfully drove the crowd back to the Parade, where they remained to monitor the situation and guard against a skirmish between the two groups of supporters.Some of those in attendance came from as far as the Eastern Cape, saying they had never been outside of their small towns in the region.Vendors also made use of the opportunity to sell ANC party paraphernalia, with one woman selling T-shirts saying she had come from Johannesburg, driving through the night to make it to Cape Town.
