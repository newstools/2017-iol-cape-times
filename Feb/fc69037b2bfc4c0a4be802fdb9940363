The defence lawyers for siblings Ibrahim and Fatima Patel yesterday stressed that their clients were not linked to terror-accused twins Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie or Isis as previously reported.The trial against the siblings is set to start next month at the Kagiso Magistrates Court.During proceedings yesterday, prosecutor Jacob Maswanganye said that the State and defence had been unable to agree on a proposed plea agreement. This meant the case would go to trial.A stun grenade and 20 rounds of ammunition were allegedly found in their house in Azaadville on the West Rand, during a raid on July 9 last year. They were charged with violating the Explosives Act and Firearms Control Act and released on R5 000 bail each.After the court adjourned, the defence attorneys for both siblings said that they did not know where the terror accusations came from.Earlier defence advocate James Grant for Ibrahim Patel told the court that charges against his client had been amended and they had only just been notified. Photographs had also surfaced that they had been unaware of and for this reason they could not immediately proceed with the trial.He added that the possibility of a plea agreement still had to be discussed with his client.Earlier Maswanganye told the court that the State was ready to proceed and all the witnesses were present except one.Defence lawyer Nadim Muhammad, acting for Fatima Patel, said information was still outstanding and he too needed more time to consult her about the plea proposal.Maswanganye said that the State would withdraw the charges against one of the siblings if the other pleaded guilty.Magistrate Stanley Mkhari argued that there had been enough time for the defence of both of the siblings to discuss which one of them would be pleading guilty.The trial is expected to start on March 23. The siblings bail of R5 000 each was extended.
