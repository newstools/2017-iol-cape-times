The ANCWL has slammed the announcement by rights group AfriForum that it was setting up a private prosecutorial unit.It said the establishment of the unit by the Afrikaner rights organisation undermined the spirit of unity in South Africa by promoting Afrikaner supremacy .Celebrated State prosecutor Gerrie Nel dropped a bombshell this week when he suddenly resigned from the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and then announced he was joining Afriforum to establish the unit.The ANCWL said that while Afriforum was within the prescripts of South Africa s constitution to establish its own private prosecutoral unit, their actions clearly demonstrate that the Codesa (Convention for a Democratic South Africa) idea of building a united prosperous SA is not embraced by all .The ANCWL said AfriForum had been party to the establishment their own university (Akademia) and their own technical college (Sol Tech) and that by establishing these parallel structures, the anti-transformation, anti-affirmative action Afrikaner formation is undermining the spirit of unity in SA and promoting Afrikaner supremacy .It said the arrogance of right-wing organisations was perpetuated by their financial muscles built through the apartheid system that benefitted the minority . The apartheid system has turned SA into having the most unequal society in the world, with high unemployment rate and poverty characterised by race. The ANCWL called on the ANC-led government to expedite land redistribution and economic transformation to reverse the imbalances created by apartheid. African News Agency
