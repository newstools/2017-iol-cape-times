Ensuring that children born prematurely have an opportunity to live a full life is the driving force behind South Africa s Olympic 400m champion sprinter Wayde van Niekerk s foundation.The Wayde Dreamer Foundation, in partnership with T-Systems, yesterday donated a patient management solution to the Newborns Groote Schuur Trust.The hospital tends to about 500 low birthweight babies a year of which Van Niekerk was one, born at 29 weeks.The unit has been using a manual system for management of communication, and tracking of patients, updating contact details and scheduling appointments was a concern. Neonatologist at the hospital, Yaseen Joolay, said the system would allow reminders of appointments to be sent to parents of premature babies, and the parents could confirm whether they would be making the appointment. Some parents do not make follow-up appointments with their child, which is crucial if the baby is premature. An infant s eyes, for example, are not fully developed if they are premature, and it is important that doctors keep track of the retina to see that it doesn't cause blindness, Joolay said.Joolay said American musician Stevie Wonder was an example of this.Wonder was born six weeks premature, and stunted growth of blood vessels in the back of his eyes caused his retinas to detach. This is preventable, Joolay said.World record holder Van Niekerk said he had many hopes and desires for his foundation, and was working to make it happen. We are trying to get more South Africans to see the world the way I have. I know we have so much potential here, and we need to invest in that, from birth. Last year Van Niekerk donated R500 000 to the hospital s neonatal unit. At the end of the day it s not about me. I am happy I am able to help, and God is to thank for that. &quot;But it s about the babies, and helping to ensure they have a future, Van Niekerk said. [email&#160;protected]
