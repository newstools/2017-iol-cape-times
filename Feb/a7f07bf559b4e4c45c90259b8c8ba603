People living with albinism suffer severe discrimination at their homes, workplaces and schools and are killed in witchcraft rituals.This emerged in a 31-minute documentary screening on Saturday at the Isivivana Centre in Khayelitsha held by the Human Rights Media Centre to shed light on the daily experiences of those with albinism. The documentary, called As We See It - Education and albinism, features Vuyiswa Kama, 66, Delicia de Vos, 40, Sonele Ntsundwana, 22, and Tono Blaai, 14, all living with albinism, and shared their experiences and the benefits and challenges of mainstream compared to special schooling.The documentary explores discrimination against people living with albinism, ranging from being called names including Umlungu (white person), wit kaffir (white skinned African), and Inkawu (an Ape) to severe forms of abuse. The film shows how many of their subjects have become fearful and sad towards themselves and others, resulting in low-self esteem, depression and even suicidal thoughts.Human Rights Media Centre director Shirley Gunn said the documentary was a result of hard work and passion, and aimed to share the experiences of those with albinism because of how little people know about the condition. Kama said parents living in her community of White City in Nyanga did not want their children to play with her. Her father abandoned her at a young age because he did not recognise her as his own child. I had this perception that if come number one or number two at my class he would change his ways and accept me. One day I got an 89% pass mark and instead of him congratulating me he asked why I did not get 100%. I was so disappointed because I did all this for my father, said Kama.Kama tried to commit suicide twice because she felt she could not face the discrimination and stigma any more.When she was born her father did not like her and treated her cruelly and differently from other siblings.Kama said she tried to enroll at Livingstone High school, a mainstream schooling, but faced challenges.Even though she sat in front of the class she could not see the chalkboard as the condition effects eyesight. Blaai encouraged people with albinism to study at special schools, citing the difficulties they may face at mainstream schools such as inability to concentrate on the chalkboard and being discriminated against, but Ntsundwana encouraged people to attend mainstream schools, as that could help with social inclusion.De Vos said she although she has been discriminated against, she managed to make something out of her life as she is a psychology undergraduate student at UNISA.John Philander, a teacher at Athlone School for the Blind said: The documentary is making a statement that all human beings are equal and should be treated equally.
