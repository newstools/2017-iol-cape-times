Six armed robbers cashed in on Sassa payday by hitting a Shoprite store, raiding money meant for poor beneficiaries.The crooks stormed the branch in the Shoprite Park complex in Parow just after 7am, while scores of social grant beneficiaries queued outside.The gun-wielding gang entered the store through the staff entrance and held up employees.A shaken Shoprite worker says they didn t even realise what was happening. We were in the store and there were about 50 people lining up for their Sassa money, the woman explained. The next moment we saw the centre manager on the floor and the police were surrounding and gun-pointing him.&quot; The police ran in and the robbers ran out through the back. Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Andr&eacute; Traut, confirmed the robbery and said the suspects were still at large. Six armed suspects fled the scene in a Toyota Quantum with an undisclosed amount of cash after threatening the employees with firearms, he said No shots were fired and no one has been arrested as yet. After the robbery, confused beneficiaries, including a number of pensioners, mulled outside the store but were left empty-handed.A broke pensioner says he was disappointed when he saw a sign on the store window saying, There will be no Sassa pay outs today . I come pay here every month, but this morning when I went inside the mall, I saw that the store was closed. I will have to go to another Shoprite now to get my money, the pensioner said.Shoprite spokesperson, Sarita van Wyk, also confirmed the robbery at the Parow store and says staff would be receiving counselling after the traumatic incident. Shoprite can confirm that a group of armed men gained entrance to the store early this morning via the staff entrance and escaped with an amount of cash, she said No one was injured and counselling is being provided in-store.
