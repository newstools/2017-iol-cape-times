AT 7pm last night, &quot;Qedani Mahlangu&quot; and &quot;Health MEC&quot; were still among the top 10 trending topics on Twitter. Users were scathing of her involvement in the Life Esidimeni scandal.@MbuyiseniNdlozi: It s not enough for #QedaniMahlangu to resign. These are not deaths but a murder, a massacre; she must face criminal charges! @MfaneloR: They killed workers in Marikana, now they killed 94 mentally ill people. Her resignation is nothing! #QedaniMahlangu must rot in jail! @MosothoFela: #QedaniMahlangu I wonder whether the ANC will be joining you in taking collective responsibility for these cruel deaths.@mphekso: #EsidimeniReport shows that the #HealthOmbud is doing an excellent job. Why are other ombudsman not doing the same?@HamieChauke: #GerrieNel How do I open a case with your new private prosecution unit? I wanna open a case of culpable homicide for #QedaniMahlangu.@tokelonhlap: When #Qedani- Mahlangu was arrogantly saying no one dies from being moved , now she s a hero because she resigned? Culpable homicide charges!@MphozaSA1: #EsidimeniReport People responsible must be charged with culpable homicide. Political opportunism by Israel and London agents must be rejected.
