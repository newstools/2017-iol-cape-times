SPRINGBOK legend Joost van der Westhuizen, who is in a critical but stable condition in the intensive care unit of Fourways Life Hospital, is putting up an incredible fight and responding well to his loved ones. This was the update given by the J9 Foundation yesterday morning. He really is our Superman! the foundation said in the wake of the former Springbok scrumhalf s readmission to hospital after he was rushed there on Saturday morning. The rugby great has been battling motor neurone disease since 2011. He has seen his condition deteriorate over the past year and has been experiencing breathing problems in recent months.This has led to him utilising an oxygen tank when required in addition to his being confined to a wheelchair. The J9 Foundation appealed to members of the public and fans of the former rugby superstar to continue praying for his full recovery. Please continue praying, the family appreciate all the support from across the world, it said. His estranged wife Amor Vittone apparently spent most of Saturday at the hospital, according to her Facebook feed. Joost at this moment is still critical in hospital, but showing us all his fighting spirit! Please keep him in your prayers and thank you for all the beautiful messages of encouragement. Jordan and Kylie have shown tremendous courage through this difficult time. Lots of love, Amor. The iconic Springbok played 89 Tests, scoring at the time a Springbok record 38 tries before being surpassed by Bryan Habana. He retired from rugby in 2003 after his third Rugby World Cup campaign.He was part of the winning Springbok team which lifted the trophy in 1995 and captained the side to third place four years later.
