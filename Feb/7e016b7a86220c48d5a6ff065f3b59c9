The outgoing chairperson of the African Union Commission, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, has joined the rest of Africa to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the adoption of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (ACDEG).As the continent commemorates this major milestone at a time of increased quest for democratic governance within the framework of Agenda 2063 &quot;The Africa We Want&quot; Dlamini-Zuma called on member states that have not yet signed and ratified the charter to do so in 2017.Adopted on January 30, 2007 by the AU Assembly of the heads of state and government, and entered into force on February 15, 2012, ACDEG draws inspiration from several AU declarations, charters and instruments, including the AU Constitutive Act.The charter asserts the eminence of democratic governance as key to achieving the continental goals of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa.It fundamentally guides AU member states on how best to inculcate a culture of democracy and peace predicated on credible and transparent elections, constitutionalism and rule of law, democratic decentralisation, human rights, gender equality and youth empowerment, among others.The outgoing chairperson is grateful that since the adoption of the charter in 2012, the continent has recorded modest gains in deepening a culture of democratic and participatory governance, respect for human rights, constitutionalism, justice and the rule of law.The African continent has also made inroads towards broadening the democratic space with women and young people as they increasingly play pivotal roles in our electoral, political and governance processes.Furthermore, state parties to the charter continue to record successes in strengthening democratic institutions, including the establishment of independent election management bodies, enhancing the capabilities of the judicial sector and institutions of accountability and transparency mechanisms.While celebrating these achievements, the outgoing AU Commission chairperson acknowledged the democratic governance deficits that Africa continues to grapple with.These include constitutional manipulations to prolong tenure by incumbents; shrinking political and civic spaces; low participation of citizens; refusal to accept election results; violations of freedom of expression and speech; violations of human rights; arbitrary arrests and detentions; limited access to media platforms; intentional internet access blockade and restrictions, among others.These challenges undoubtedly limit the realisation of the promises of democracy of improved livelihoods, inclusive popular participation, gender equity, youth empowerment and a conducive environment that upholds human and people s rights on the continent.
