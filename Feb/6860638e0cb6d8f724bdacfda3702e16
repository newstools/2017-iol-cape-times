Du Noon Primary School received a donation of a fully equipped cyber lab from the National Department of Human Settlements and Vodacom yesterday.Speaking at the handover of the lab s information and communication technology (ICT) equipment that included 26 tablets and free internet access to educational sites, Deputy Minister of Human Settlements Zoe Kota-Fredericks said: The intervention by the department and Vodacom is aimed at addressing cost challenges associated with access to education and to help provide internet connectivity to schools, especially in areas like Du Noon, which is experiencing a high population growth, thus affecting the quality of not only household life, but the education of the children in these areas as well. She hoped that by providing the cyber lab to the school, its pupils would receive a good education to be able to contribute in government programmes to fight poverty and inequality and also assist in finding solutions to the problems facing the country and ensure that, as envisioned by the National Development Plan, we have sustainable human settlements that are inclusive, resilient and liveable .Vodacom s Western Cape regional executive manager, Alberts Breed, said the telecoms giant believed that access to education through digital tools was one of the key ways through which educational outcomes could be improved. Vodacom realises the importance of technology, especially mobile broadband and digital education services, in transforming the delivery of education, addressing current challenges and creating a platform for South Africa to leapfrog its education evolution process, he said. At Vodacom, our aim is to use technology to help make a difference in the communities where our customers live. &quot;Through this initiative, Vodacom seeks to enable pupils with ICT tools and free internet connectivity, he added.Access to reading material was a major challenge in South Africa, he said, and because many people did not have access to libraries and reading material, Vodacom, together with its partners, believed it could help address this challenge by broadening access to literacy in this way. Supporting education is a key focus for Vodacom. This project reflects our commitment to weigh in on, and help improve, the standard and quality of education in our country.
