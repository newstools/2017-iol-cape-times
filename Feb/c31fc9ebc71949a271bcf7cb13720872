Weak systems beget more collusion or, more precisely, corruption, writes Victor Kgomoeswana. Just why are we rattled by the recommendations of the Competition Commission that the Competition Tribunal should prosecute 17 banks for allegedly colluding to manipulate the exchange rate of the rand? This is a mere symptom of a system that has given too much leeway to banks. It has happened everywhere else in the world, it is still happening now and it will happen again. </p> </p> The commission statement said: From at least 2007, the respondents had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for the spot trades in relation to currency trading involving the US dollar/rand currency pair .</p> </p> </p> 2007 was followed a year later by the global credit crunch; and all this time we thought our banks were solid.</p> </p> </p> This suggests that banks fixed the price of currencies to score big on translation gains (our loss) in their international dealings.</p> </p> </p> Translation gain or loss is a profit or loss incurred by a business due to fluctuations in the value of its currency, when such a currency is expressed in terms of another.</p> </p> </p> Since we pay for oil imports, electronic and other goods in foreign currencies, we paid dearly as a result, due to imported inflation and higher interest rates in the name of inflation targeting.</p> </p> </p> Let us consider how much the value of major currencies can change in one day to appreciate the gravity of the commission s findings.</p> </p> </p> At 5pm on Friday, the dollar cost R13.0327, having opened at R13.0323.</p> </p> </p> The difference in eight hours was a measly 0.003%.
