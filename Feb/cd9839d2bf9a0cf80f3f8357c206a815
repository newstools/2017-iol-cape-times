About 300 000 financial assistance applications have been approved for the 2017 academic year at South African tertiary institutions.The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has approved funding for 291 747 students.Briefing the portfolio committee on higher education and training in Parliament yesterday, NSFASchairperson Sizwe Nxasana said the scheme expected to increase this record pool by today, the closing date for financial assistance for Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) college applications.Nxasana said the majority of students were already registered at universities, while the registration for TVET colleges was still under way. More than 180 944 of these students are at universities, while 110 803 are TVET college students. Of the 180 944 university students, 71 098 are new students, while 109 846 are returning students, Nxasana said. While the closing date for application for financial assistance at the TVET colleges is February 17, already 15 375 new students and 95 428 returning students in the TVET colleges have been approved. NSFAS management acknowledged the delays in communicating the outcome of the results of applications to some of the students.Nxasana said the delays could be attributed to a number of challenges, including the changes in last year s academic calendars at some institutions, as well as a significant number of applications that had been received missing supporting documents. Overall, 9 976 applications were unsuccessful due to financial ineligibility, as they were categorised within the missing middle category, Nxasana said. However, these students could appeal against the decision, he said. African News Agency
