The National Prosecuting Authority has asked the Western Cape High Court to imprison a police officer found guilty of murdering his girlfriend about three years ago for life.Sentencing procedures against convicted Lindani Nakani will start on Monday.Judge Nolwazi Boqwana found Nakani intentionally killed Busiswa Centane while she sat in her silver Toyota Yaris in front of her house in 2014.During the trial witnesses told of a violent relationship between Nakani and Centane, who had lived together.NPA spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila welcomed Nakani s conviction yesterday.He hoped that Judge Boqwana would impose the prescribed minimum sentence, which is life imprisonment.He said the NPA was asking for a life sentence because the murder was premeditated.Ntabazalila said Nakani murdered the woman brutally and did not show any mercy when he emptied a full magazine of bullets into her body leaving her with 42 wounds.Nakani often visited Centane and would assault, insult and threaten her. He did this while violating a protection order that was granted by the Bellville Magistrates' Court. &quot;He was also ordered by the court not to carry a firearm. Violence against women and children are some of the crimes the NPA has prioritised. &quot;We have prosecutors that are dedicated to dealing with matters involving vulnerable groups, which include murders and crimes against women and children. Ntabazalila commented further that the NPA had managed to secure successful prosecutions followed by good sentences in a record period, as a result of the dedication we have put into these types of cases .
