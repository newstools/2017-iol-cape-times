Cape Town The DA has asked its lawyers to file papers in the Western Cape High Court to challenge the decision of Parliament to deploy soldiers in the institution during the State of the Nation Address.President Jacob Zuma had confirmed early in the week that a total of 411 soldiers would be deployed to maintain law and order.The EFF had threatened for weeks before the SONA that it would disrupt proceedings. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said they did not want the army to be in Parliament, but Zuma deployed it.During the SONA on Thursday EFF leader Julius Malema told Zuma that he may deploy hundreds of troops in Parliament, but the problem was not outside it was inside the Chamber.This was in reference to their insistence that they will not allow Zuma to address Parliament unless he stepped down. The EFF has been disrupting Parliament over the last three years with the disruptions getting violent since 2015. Maimane said they did not want the army in Parliament. We have this morning instructed our lawyers to file an application in the Western Cape High Court seeking a declaration that the deployment of SANDF members on the precinct for non-ceremonial purposes was unconstitutional and unlawful, so as to ensure the gradual securitisation and militarisation of Parliament is halted once and for all, said Maimane.He said the use of pepper-spray in the gallery by the security officers of Parliament on Thursday was also unacceptable.Political Bureau
