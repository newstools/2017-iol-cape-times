JUDGMENT has been reserved in a lengthy court matter between the city and the South Road Families Association (SRFA), whose members could lose their homes if plans to build a MyCiTi bus route through Wynberg go ahead.The city has appealed against a court order that halted its plans to build the bus route.Acting Judge Leslie Weinkove in 2015 ruled that if the city is to proceed with its plan of demolishing houses and issuing termination of lease orders to South Road residents, a meaningful public-participation process must be implemented to discuss alternative routes.Mayco member for transport and urban development Brett Herron said the city appealed to the Western Cape High Court against the order yesterday. The Supreme Court of Appeal granted the city leave to appeal against the judgment and order granted by Judge Weinkove. At this stage, we are awaiting judgment, Herron said.In a statement, the families affected said: The residents of South Road successfully prosecuted their application in the high court despite attempts by the city to delay the matter. As a result, the City of Cape Town, displeased by the court s finding, sought leave to appeal. Their application for leave to appeal was refused. The city then proceeded to petition the Supreme Court of Appeal, who granted them leave to appeal to a full bench in the (Western) Cape High Court. Staff Writer
