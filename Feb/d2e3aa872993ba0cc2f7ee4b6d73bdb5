&nbsp;Along with higher taxes for the rich, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on Wednesday announced some relief for the poor in the form of marginally increased welfare grants.The old age grant will increase by R90 to R1 600 for pensioners over the age of 60 and to R1620 for those over 75.The disability and care dependency grants also increase by R90 to R1 600 a month, while foster care grants and child support grants will increase by R30 and R20 a month respectively.The increases will take effect from April 1.The announcement comes amid a huge controversy over how grants will be distributed to the country s 17 million grant recipients from that date, as a Constitutional Court deadline for the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) to put in place a new system to distribute grants to beneficiaries.The court invalidated Sassa s contract with Cash Paymaster Services but suspended its ruling until March 31 so as not to disrupt delivery.Grant payment falls within the mandate of Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini who opposes a proposal by National Treasury to give commercial banks a role in distribution.She is seen as favouring a further extension of CPS s contract.In the Estimates of National Expenditure, National Treasury said Sassa currently spent R2 billion a year to pay for grant distribution, and was expected to continue doing so. This baseline is expected to be maintained over the medium term. A considerable part of this is expected to be spent on technology as Sassa sets about digitalising and automating files and services in preparation for eventually taking over the distribution function itself.The project is expected to be completed in the coming financial year, with a budget allocation of R51 million compared to R40 million in 2016/17.
