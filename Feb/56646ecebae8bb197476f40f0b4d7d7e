ANC national executive committee member Fikile Mbalula has warned troublemakers hoping to gatecrash the party's People s Assembly during&nbsp;State of the Nation Address that they would be dealt with harshly.The ANC head of organising addressed the media yesterday on preparations for the event taking place on the day President Jacob Zuma is scheduled to deliver his speech.Mbalula said the party had permission to have 30 000 people gather at Cape Town's Grand Parade from 3pm.He said ANC leaders as well as their alliance partners who were not MPs would be in attendance to address the crowd and added that ANC MPs, alongside the president, would join the event after Zuma had finished his address.He added that the president would not be making a second address as there would be no need to &quot;bore&quot; the masses with a similar speech, saying his appearance would be merely a &quot;meet and greet&quot;. It is our own endeavour not to become onlookers and entertain what opposition parties and everybody else does as though we don't have a programme of action he said.Mbalula pointed out that the event was open to everyone but added that those with ulterior motives would be dealt with.Last year, police had the task of separating feuding ANC members and those from the EFF in the city centre just hours before proceedings got under way in Parliament.Stun grenades and water cannons had to be used on groups of protesters along Adderley Street, which had been closed off for the Sona proceedings. We are very peaceful and we don't want people who come to attend the People's Assembly with good intentions being provoked by anarchists, said Mbalula. So people who are bringing anarchy and their shenanigans in Parliament, they have their space, so it is not necessary to interfere with an ANC event. &quot;We have booked and we have permission (to be there); we don't want intruders who are coming with the intention to disrupt, he said. The people who would have gathered there are single-minded, but if you come there with your shenanigans of trying to disrupt, we will deal with you, he said.Mbalula added that the event would be held under the theme of &quot;radical economic transformation.&quot;
