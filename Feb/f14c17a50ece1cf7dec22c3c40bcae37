Ministers in the international co-operation, trade and security cluster are pushing for the reduction of data costs in South Africa.Posts and Telecommunications Minister Siyabonga Cwele said yesterday they would be meeting with the operators on pushing down data costs.In addition, they want to open up the market to small players, to create competition and force reduction in prices. Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa said this was a regional plan, but they wanted South Africa to implement it immediately.In the Southern African Development Community, moves are already afoot to meet with the operators to push down roaming prices.She said President Jacob Zuma had also made this clear in his State of the Nation Address, and the government was concerned about high data costs. President Zuma announced in the Sona that government and the regulatory institutions will continue to focus on efforts to reduce the cost of communication, including data. They wanted to engage with the operators to reduce roaming costs in the Southern Africa region as well.This was reiterated by Cwele, who said that they were meeting with the regulator to promote the project.However, they also have to meet with the operators on data reduction costs. Cwele said in East Africa they implemented the roaming home and away product, and it did not affect the profits.Instead, there was an increase in volume in the domestic market.Cwele said the government was aware that people were concerned about the high cost of data in the country.Last year, R40 million was spent supporting the wi-fi programme in municipalities.The government had asked the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa to conduct a study on the cost of data. The study will focus on competition in the market. Cwele said that last year the cabinet approved a policy that would allow small and medium enterprises to come into the market. This would increase competition and force prices to come down. It is only when you have competitive service providers that you will bring the cost of data down, he said.Cwele also said Icasa would finish its study this year on the cost of communication.The portfolio committee on posts and telecommunications last year held public hearings on the cost of data.
