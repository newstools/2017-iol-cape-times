Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies has reiterated the government s intention to save the local poultry industry and protect it from the importing of cheap chicken from the EU and Brazil.Davies told a radio station yesterday that the government would do whatever was necessary to safeguard the local poultry sector.The industry is bleeding jobs after cheap chicken from the EU and Brazil has filled the shelves in supermarkets and other stores. Davies said the economy had been badly affected by the slump in commodity prices in the mining sector, but the industry was recovering.He called on South Africa to move to higher value chains.He warned that the country could no longer rely on mining to create jobs and grow the economy.Mining contributes 7% to the economy, and has shed more than 40 000 jobs in the past six years.Davies said they needed to move to other sectors of the economy. Let s take the poultry industry, we have to say we won t allow your imports. We will use our trade instruments, he pointed out. If we are not going to defend it, we will lose our industry, he said.The poultry industry had been under severe strain in recent months, with the loss of thousands of jobs. More jobs were on the line if there was no intervention.The state has set up a task team to implement ways to rescue the poultry industry. One of these is to use anti-dumping measures to protect the import of cheap chicken from the EU and Brazil.Davies wants transformation and competitiveness in the poultry sector to save it.The industry has threatened more job losses if the government did not move fast.The Department of Trade and Industry has said it believed the task team would be able to come up with solutions to the chicken import crisis.
