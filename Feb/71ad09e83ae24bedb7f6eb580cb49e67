A mangled wreck was all that remained of a vehicle hit by a train in Pretoria North on Thursday.Its doors were broken off and its body squashed and unrecognisable. The driver had to be rescued with the Jaws of Life.The train collided with the car at a level crossing in Jan van Riebeeck Street, next to the SA Mint Company.According to emergency services and eye witnesses, it appeared that the driver tried to beat the train at the crossing, which had flashing lights but no guard rail.Locals said the vehicle had been dragged some distance by the train. The driver was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries.Metrorail spokesperson Mmakgotso Tsheko said accidents at the site occurred mostly when motorists tried to beat the train at the crossing. Unfortunately, many of them don t make it out alive; some die on the scene while others die in hospital, Tsheko said.However, some locals believe there has to be a system in place that warns drivers of oncoming trains, because the flashing lights are dysfunctional. These red lights do not work, and they make it difficult for drivers to establish if the train is coming or not, said Mariam Marumo.The cause of Thursday's accident was still unknown but investigations were under way, said Tshwane Emergency Services spokesperson Johan Pieterse. We are not sure what happened but the driver is in a critical condition and was transported to Steve Biko Academic Hospital, Pieterse said.The accident comes after 216 passengers were injured during a collision between two Metrorail trains on Monday.The trains were fully occupied during peak hour when the collision happened.The trains were believed to be travelling in opposite directions but were on the same track.
