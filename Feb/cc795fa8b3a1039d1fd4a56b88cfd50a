Dutch gangsters came to South Africa and took the land, EFF leader Julius Malema said on Tuesday during the expropriation of land debate in the National Assembly.&quot;This is a motion which seems to unite South Africans. The land should have been returned to its rightful owners,&quot; Malema said, referring to land reform.Fellow EFF member Floyd Shivambu said: &quot;Legislations are deliberately delayed. He (President Jacob Zuma) must immediately sign it into law so that we can fight financial crimes and money laundering, there are also many other legislations that need to be passed into law.&quot;IFP deputy secretary-general Christan Themba Msimang said the government should prioritise giving land back to those who need it the most, while National Freedom Party member Ahmed Munzoor Shaik Emam agreed, saying &quot;the restitution of land is not good enough, no amount of compensation is good enough&quot;.DA spokesperson for rural development and land reform Thomas Walters blamed the ANC for South Africa's poor being landless. &quot;It is not clause 25 of the constitution that leaves the rural poor in former homelands, without title deed on the land they have farmed for generations. Rural poor are deliberately kept in poverty to lock them into voting for the ANC.&quot;&nbsp;Emam went on to say radical economic transformation was needed and that the first step is for every South African to keep their dignity intact.Referring to the loss of land for the majority during historical events like colonialism and apartheid, Emam said: &quot;They need to address what they took and what they got for it. Expedite the process of restitution.&quot;
