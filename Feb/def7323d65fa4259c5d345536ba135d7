President Jacob Zuma has turned South Africa into a police state, DA chief whip John Steenhuisen charged on Thursday night, after the EFF MPs were dragged out of the National Assembly.After the DA left the National Assembly, leaving Zuma to finally deliver his speech to a half-empty Chamber, Steenhuisen said South Africans would rise against him for returning to apartheid era security tactics. President Jacob Zuma had led this country into a police state. We saw what PW Botha did in the 1980s when he turned the security forces on the citizens of the country. The people rose against them and they will rise against Zuma. Steenhuisen said even if the DA felt the EFF took it bit too far when they heckled and interjected for more than an hour, the use of force was excessive and the deployment of military and riot police in Parliament was wholly unlawful. It was not commensurate, the level of violence and damage does not belong in a constitutional democracy. Fellow DA MP Gavin Davis said he was shocked to see security men kick EFF women who had fallen to the ground. It was sickening. African News Agency
