Hundreds of people gathered at the St George s Cathedral on Wednesday, where the Save South Africa campaign gave civil society organisations and individuals a platform to air their concerns around the state of the country.On the eve of President Jacob Zuma s State of the Nation address (Sona) in Parliament, Save SA stressed the importance of giving a voice to South Africans who felt neglected by the current government.Founding member of the campaign, Lawson Naidoo, said: We need to hold the president accountable for making empty promises. Lawson was, however, positive about the country s future, saying: Hearing today s youth, South Africa has a bright future, so it is time we nurture our youth. There was also an opportunity for members of the public to write down what they thought should be addressed by Zuma during Sona on Thursday. Messages included: Buy medicine for our people, not Nkandlas , and Stop the looting .The Sonke Gender Justice organisation called for an improvement in women s rights, saying that women deserved to be on par with men in industry and the home, and called for Zuma to address the issue in his speech.Convener for the Save SA committee Sipho Pityana read out a Dear Zuma plea in which he said: You are not trusted by your own party or its allies. We have no confidence in your ability. He said it is time for Zuma to tell the nation what progress he had made since his last Sona, rather than making empty promises. Look at the mess you have plunged our country into. How much land has been redistributed during your presidency? Shouldn t you be resigning? asked Pityana.Hundreds of people gathered in the cathedral agreed with Pityana when he said Zuma was at the centre of nepotism, corruption and State capture . Comrades and friends, let tomorrow be the last Sona for Zuma, only then will South Africa be saved, added Pityana. African News Agency
