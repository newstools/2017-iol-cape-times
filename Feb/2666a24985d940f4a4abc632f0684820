Traffic officers literally had to carry a drunk driver to safety after his drinking binge caused him to black out in the middle of an intersection in Table View at the weekend, the City of Cape Town said yesterday.Officers of the City s ghost squad were conducting an operation focusing on illegal street racing on Sunday night when they came across a car that had entered the intersection of Blaauwberg Road and Janssens Avenue at around 10pm. They found that the driver had passed out behind the wheel, with an empty whisky bottle and a second, nearly empty bottle on the passenger seat.&quot;It took three officers to lift the unconscious driver out of the vehicle. The vehicle was obstructing traffic and had to be moved, said the City s Mayoral Committee Member for Safety, Security and Social Services JP Smith.According to the statement, officers arrested eight more drivers for drunk driving and two for reckless and negligent driving after they were caught participating in an illegal street race. - African News Agency
