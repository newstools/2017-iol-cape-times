Masiphumelele community activist Sibusiso Brown, facing a murder charge dating back to 2015, was this week charged with attempted murder.It is alleged that he shot another man. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said an attempted murder case against Brown was under investigation.The Simon s Town Magistrate's Court released him on R500 bail with conditions: he must report to the Ocean View Police Station twice a week. Brown maintains that he is innocent and could not have shot the complainant because he is walking on crutches, and believes the charges are a plot because he is vocal about drug dealers and service delivery in Masiphumelele. Last month he was shot twice, in his buttocks and ankle, allegedly by suspected gangsters, who kicked down the door of his shack and fired several shots. Brown had been asleep with his partner, Nolubabalo Majola, and their one-year-old baby daughter when he was shot. The gunman had aimed for their heads, but they had been sleeping with their heads at the foot of the bed, which was why Brown was hit in the ankle and buttocks. Brown and Majola played dead after the gunmen shot at them. A community leader who is known to the Cape Times, but who wanted to remain anonymous, said community leaders were being targeted by drug dealers because they spoke out against drug use and had raided several drug dens in the community.
