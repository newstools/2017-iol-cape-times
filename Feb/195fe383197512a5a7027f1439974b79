WHILE politics might not always be regarded as a popular search topic, this year s State of the Nation address (Sona) roused the interest of scores of South Africans online.This was according to an analysis of local social media searches last week which was conducted by global media intelligence provider Meltwater.It found that within South Africa, mentions of the keywords State of the Nation or Sona steadily increased across both online editorial news sites and social media.The search for the acronym Sona, which is the official opening of Parliament where President Jacob Zuma reports back on the status of the nation, also saw a spike last Wednesday, the day before the official ceremony. From February 2 to February 8, the Meltwater analysis found that the sentiment across editorial media had been predominantly neutral, with David Ortlipp, managing director of Meltwater Cape Town, suggesting journalistic reporting of Sona had been non-partisan in the majority of cases.He added that South African social media featured a more distinct positive, which was around 17%, and negative which came in at about 25% split in sentiment, as tends to be the nature of more opinion-rich mediums.Meanwhile, Twitter ranked as the top social media platform for those mentioning Sona. This may be because Twitter is the platform most used for political debate and engaging in conversations beyond friend groups, Thomas believes. It s especially true for the trending hashtags that have surfaced this week, ie #SONA2017 and #SONAPredictions. Facebook finished in second place for those who mentioned the event, followed by Instagram, forums, YouTube and, lastly, blogs.Thomas added the analysis also found that social media exploded after Zuma disclosed the government would be spend R204 000 on the deployment of the SANDF at Sona. The president s alleged reasoning was that a security presence was needed to enforce law and order and avoid interruptions by protesters. #SONAPredictions was also a main trend on Twitter in South Africa last week. It consisted mostly of a stream of jokes and memes about what would happen at Sona, and what Jacob Zuma and Julius Malema would say, said Thomas.
