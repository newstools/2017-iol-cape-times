Newseum visitors love to read front pages from around the country and the world, and we re grateful for the Cape Times s continued participation, he said.Cape Times editor Aneez Salie said: It is really heartening that the honouring of our front pages by the Newseum, five now, has proven to be no flash in the pan. In fact, many papers here and abroad are adopting our style, which is very humbling. It also negates the efforts of those who sought to rubbish the change in ownership, leadership and ethos at the Cape Times and Independent Newspapers, who predicted we would fall.
