You can use the hooter, flash your lights, put your emergency lights on or shoutBe aware &nbsp;of anybody who approaches your car or is loitering near traffic lights, stop streets, parking areas or your driveway.Don't stop &nbsp;if, for example, a passer-by indicates that your car has a flat tyre or other defect.
