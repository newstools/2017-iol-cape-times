Anti-apartheid activist Peter Mentoor remains frustrated after scheduled arbitration with Statistics SA at the General Public Service Sector Bargaining Council was postponed for the third time.Mentoor said Stats SA unfairly dismissed him during his training period for an enumerator position due to his conviction under the apartheid-era Gatherings Act in 1983.The meeting was set to take place yesterday between Mentoor and the two entities at Stats SA s offices only to be informed Stats SA s request for postponement to the council had been granted. This is the third time this has been postponed and I was not informed, as they sent the communication to my former legal representative. This has dragged on for such a long time and it seems those in charge are uncaring, hoping I will eventually tire. He said for his crime he was given merely a suspended sentence, fined R100, and the charges were of a political nature and not criminal. This whole matter is frustrating and I am almost at my wits end. &quot;Yet I will persevere as I have been unfairly treated and dismissed without proper labour procedures being followed. He was considering his options and awaited a new date for arbitration, which depended on the Bargaining Council.Officials from the Bargaining Council confirmed that postponements were considered after a written request, and that it was up to them to agree to it.While communication was forwarded, their offices had not been informed of Mentoor no longer using the services of his legal counsel and a new date is yet to be confirmed.Stats SA spokesperson Trevor Oosterwyk said he did not have any personal problems with Mentoor.He said there had been previous attempts to resolve the issue between Stats SA and Mentoor, but he would not comment on the matter.
