Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Groenewald on Wednesday boldly asked President Jacob Zuma what his problem with white people was. Honourable Mr President, what do you have against white people in South Africa? Every time there s something wrong, you blame the white people of South Africa, Groenewald said in an impassioned speech while participating in the parliamentary debate on Zuma s State of the Nation address. You using white people of South Africa as a smoke screen to hide your own inabilities and incompetencies. Much of the right leaning party leader s speech was drowned out by shouting from ruling party MPs, especially when Groenewald criticised Zuma for his attempts at radical economic transformation and policies set to benefit black people, saying it would bankrupt the country. If you want economic growth to create jobs, put a moratorium on black economic empowerment and affirmative action, then you will get the growth, he said to an outcry from MPs seated on Zuma s side of the National Assembly.
