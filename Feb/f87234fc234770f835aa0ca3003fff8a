Just before the president goes to Parliament to share what he intends to do for the country this year, the DA has said that all we could look forward to was another year of broken promises .Yesterday, DA leader Mmusi Maimane said they expected President Jacob Zuma to use this opportunity to make a long list of promises and deliverables, which will not be heard of again after the speech is finished .Maimane said the reasoning behind this expectation was that Zuma had broken more promises than he kept in the 2016 edition of the State of the Nation Address (Sona).Citing examples of this, Maimane made reference to the promise to empower small, micro and macro enterprises (SMMEs) to ensure the National Development Plan s goal of these being the primary providers of jobs. This has simply not been achieved. SMMEs continue to struggle in an economic and labour environment not conducive to growth. StatsSA s latest statistics on liquidations and insolvencies for December 2016 revealed that there was a year-on-year increase of 3.4% more liquidations. This indicates SMMEs require much more support, he said. Maimane also made mention of the promise to finalise the development of a comprehensive social security policy, the establishment of state-owned pharmaceutical company Ketlaphela and the promise to fast-track the rollout of the first phase of broadband to connect more than 5 000 government facilities all promises that Maimane said the Zuma-led administration had failed to keep. He added that Zuma s speech would also touch on the issue of the lost generation , which Maimane said was a segment of society that had been abandoned by a directionless, uncaring and power-hungry ANC.He added that the DA would be putting forward coherent policy alternatives that would work to ensure that those excluded from the economy and opportunities were included, so that their lives were made better and South Africa could build a dynamic, flourishing economy.
