Camps Bay beach was full as beachgoers went to escape the 30&ordm;C heat yesterday.Visitors and schoolchildren continued to flock to the beaches, and more were expected this weekend, said City safety and security director Richard Bosman. Beaches continue to experience a steady stream of visitors.We expect the coming weekend to be busy once again as it s the last weekend before schools start. Although there is a steady number of visitors given the warm weather and the fact that it is still school holidays, the number of visitors is not at the level of New Year s Day, he said.Bosman said Muizenberg, Strand and Camps Bay were the busiest beaches. He said no drownings had been reported this past week.
