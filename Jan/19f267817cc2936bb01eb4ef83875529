Statistics show that water consumption in Cape Town has dropped since Christmas but was still too high, raising the spectre of further restrictions, the city said on Wednesday.Residents used some 835 million litres per day during the week of 19 to 25 December 2016, and this dropped to 829 million litres per day in the week from Boxing Day to January 1, 2017. While the City of Cape Town is pleased with the improvement, this is still 29 million litres per day above the level required to ensure that water supply will last until the next rainy season, the city said.Dam levels in the Western Cape have dropped to 46 percent, with several hot, dry months ahead before winter. Unless all residents reduce their water usage to meet the target, even more stringent restrictions are likely in the near future, including a possible blanket ban on all watering of gardens. It said the reduction in usage did indicate that more residents were starting to take the restrictions seriously. The City appeals to those residents who are choosing to be part of the solution to please keep it up. African News Agency
