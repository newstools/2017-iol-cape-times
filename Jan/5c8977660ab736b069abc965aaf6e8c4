THREE crew members were rescued and treated for shock after their 6m ski-boat, MI Lady, capsized off Strand Beach yesterday. The National Sea Rescue Institute said the three Strand residents, aged 55, 42 and 20, appeared to have been in the water for more than an hour before being brought to the NSRI base in Gordon's Bay. Two of them were found sitting on the upturned hull of the boat while one was clinging to the vessel. NSRI Gordon's Bay station commander Alan Meiklejohn said they, along with the Strandfontein duty crews, had been activated by the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) following Telkom Maritime Radio Services intercepting a radio distress call from the boat reporting that it was taking water.The co-ordinates provided by the crew of MI Lady were 3km off Strand beach and 7km off Macassar beach before communications were lost. On arrival on the scene, off-shore of Strand Beach, the crew of the casualty craft set off a distress smoke marker which assisted us to locate them swiftly.&quot;Their boat was found to be capsized with three male crew at the craft. &quot;Two were sitting on the upturned hull of the boat and one was clinging to the upturned hull of the craft, he said. In a separate incident, a man was rushed to hospital in a critical condition following a near-drowning accident at Muizenberg beach yesterday. Cape Medical Response and Life Care response paramedics responded. Following extensive CPR efforts, the man was successfully resuscitated by paramedics and transported to hospital, said NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon.
