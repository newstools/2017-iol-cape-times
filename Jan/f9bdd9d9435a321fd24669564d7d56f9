THE suspension of six DA councillors who defied the party s instruction by electing their subcouncil chairperson has been lifted, but the party s federal legal commission (FLC) is still investigating their conduct.Brenda Hansen, Marian Nieuwoudt, Carin Brynard, Siseko Mbandezi and Xoliswa Pakela-Mapasa were suspended for insubordination after they defied the DA s instruction and voted Grant Twigg as sub-council 2 chairperson in November, overlooking preferred candidate Clive Justus. The DA s metro executive then met to discuss the issue and subcouncil manager Fred Monk was called to have the election scrapped, and for the meeting of the subcouncil to be reconvened, so that another vote could take place. Twigg then received a letter of suspension from Shaun August.DA spokesperson Anneke Scheepers said: Those (councillors) in question are currently making their representations to the FLC, as the investigation is ongoing. As the matter is ongoing, we are still awaiting the final report from the FLC. Yesterday, Twigg said he and his five fellow councillors had attended the DA s caucus meeting before Thursday's council meeting. He insisted he was still the chairperson of subcouncil 2 and that there would be no new vote; that has been done and dusted .
