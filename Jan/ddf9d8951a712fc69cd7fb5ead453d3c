Durban - The ANC Women s League has called for a full-scale investigation into the theft of billions of rand during apartheid, implicating Absa in the matter.ANCWL secretary-general Meokgo Matuba said on Saturday they would call on President Jacob Zuma to launch an inquiry into the matter. While the leaked report is a preliminary one, the ANCWL still holds the view that there should be a full-scale investigation on the CIEX report and all those implicated, said Matuba.The leaked public protector report found that billions had been looted and recommended Absa repay R2.24bn.Black Land First leader Andile Mngxitama threatened to unleash a full-frontal attack on white monopoly capital after seeing the report.Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane reportedly provisionally found that the government had breached the supreme law of the country and the Public Finance Management Act.Absa said the report contained several factual and legal inaccuracies and the leak was regrettable. We are pleased with the progress and dismiss Absa s objections, said Mngxitama, who alleged R26bn was looted. They are desperate to take the focus away from the issue by refusing to take responsibility, apologise and pay back the money. ANC spokeswoman Khusela Sangoni said the party would await the finalisation of the public protector s report.Sunday Tribune
