WITH the unique Montrose Equine Youth Development Programme having successfully rehabilitated hundreds of at-risk youngsters over the years, South Africa's premier horseracing festival, L Ormarins Queen s Plate (LQP), has chosen the Montrose Foundation as the official beneficiary for this year s inaugural festival.Last year, LQP s donation to the Montrose Foundation went towards the funding of the Durbanville Children's Home and Bosasa Horizon youth groups, with 16 youngsters taking part in the Equine Youth Development Programme. Apart from being the highlight of the Cape social calendar, the L Ormarins Queen s Plate has long aimed to aid local communities and causes and The Montrose Foundation speaks to the spirit of LQP bringing people and horses together, says 2017 L Ormarins Queen s Plate co-ordinator Katherine Gray.Equine Assisted intervention has gained recognition and popularity due to its successful non-traditional approach to psychotherapy. The unique programme teaches vulnerable youth to address dysfunctional behaviour and challenging life situations as well as empower them to make positive life choices. For many of these children, interacting with horses is the first time in their lives that they experience an authentic relationship. These keenly intuitive animals continue to heal and help many young people to see their own potential and interest in living a fulfilling life through the process of equine-assisted intervention, said Montrose Foundation general manager Sunette de Flamingh. It is inspiring to witness the emotional growth and positive life changes in these children. It makes us deeply grateful to the L Ormarins Queen s Plate for its continued support, she said.In an effort to raise funds, LQP has partnered with the luxurious Amaani Blue Train and will be running a raffle where guests can win two 5-star tickets on the Blue Train while all money received will be donated to the Montrose Foundation in order to support its equine programmes.The elegant horse-racing event was a wonderful combination of glamour and equine excellence, with DJ Ephonik kicking off the afterparty on the decks.The 18 races were split over two days: eight on Friday, January 6 and a 10-race card on Saturday, January 7.Friday s festivities saw LQP s first Garden Party featuring a four-piece jazz band, bubbly and nibbles. It ended at 6pm and on Saturday at 11pm.LQP was at Kenilworth, where jockey Anton Marcus won on Legal Eagle .
