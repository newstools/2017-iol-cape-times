President Jacob Zuma is expected back in the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in the coming weeks to back the National Prosecuting Authority s case to drop charges against him ahead of the elections in 2009.This comes at a time that Zuma is in his final months in office as leader of the ANC, and two years before he completes his term as president of the country.Zuma has been in and out of court over the corruption-charges case in the last eight years since then NPA acting head Mokotedi Mpshe dropped the charges.Yesterday, the official opposition said it was waiting on the SCA to give it a date for oral argument with Zuma. This followed the SCA s ruling in October that Zuma needed to file extra papers and present an oral argument in court.The president is appealing the decision of the high court in Pretoria that the NPA should reinstate the charges against him. Zuma s spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga could not be reached for comment yesterday.The opposition parties have been calling for Zuma to have his day in court, but the president has fought against the reinstatement of the charges.The Constitutional Court refused to hear an application by the NPA after the high court said the charges must be reinstated.The high court in Pretoria ruled in February last year that the NPA s decision to withdraw charges was irrational and must be set aside.A full bench of the high court heard the application between Zuma and the oppo- sition.Zuma was facing a challenge within the ANC after some of the members and veterans called for him to resign. But he refused to do so, saying he had not done anything wrong.This was after former public protector Thuli Madonsela released the state capture report.The president is contesting the report, saying he was going to court to challenge it.At the January&nbsp;8 celebrations, he described Andrew Mlangeni and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela as the real veterans of the ANC, and not the others .The two ANC stalwarts attended the celebrations in Vilakazi Street, Orlando, last Friday where Zuma addressed the crowd.His supporters in the ANC have also backed him and said he would complete his term as both head of state and leader of the ANC.The court hearing in the SCA will begin at a time when factions in the ANC are at each other s throats on who will succeed him at the party s conference in December.
