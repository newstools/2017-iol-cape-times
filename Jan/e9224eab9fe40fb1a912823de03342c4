Durban Hundreds of Economic Freedom Fighters supporters gathered outside Durban's Westville Prison on Sunday as party leader Julius Malema visited the sole remaining #FeesMustFall student still in custody. Malema arrived mid-morning to visit Bonginkosi Khanyile, a Durban University of Technology student awaiting trial for allegedly using a slingshot at a #FeesMustFall protest in September last year.

A subsequent appeal to the High Court was also unsuccessful. EFF supporters outside Westville Prison on Sunday carried placards calling for him to be freed. African News Agency
