Helsinki: In its first regular working week of 2017, Finland launched a two-year nationwide experiment offering a basic income to a limited pool of part-time employees and the unemployed.Some 2 000 randomly selected participants are to receive a monthly payment of 560 euros (586 dollars), which is not taxed. Recipients can even keep the benefit if they also earn money from employment.According to Marjukka Turunen, head of the legal affairs unit at KELA, Finlands social welfare agency, the goal of the programme is to see if a long-debated basic income policy can boost employment and adapt the countrys social welfare system to the labour market trend towards more temporary contracts and freelance work.The programme could also help reduce the bureaucratic burden , both for welfare agency employees and recipients of benefits, since beneficiaries would not have to spend time filling out detailed forms.The income is also regular, like a monthly salary, offering better means of planning and more security. The first payment of the welfare experiment, launched on Monday, is due on January 9.Of those receiving the income, some have been unemployed for years , Turunen told dpa, while some only lost work in October and received their first unemployment benefit in November.Participants aged between 25 and 58 were drawn from all over the country of 5.5 million people. Turunen said 48 percent of the group were women and 52 percent men, and were picked from a pool of 175 000 people who received a labour market subsidy or a basic unemployment allowance in November.Although the US, Canada and the Netherlands have previously tested similar programmes, this is the first nationwide programme , according to Turunen.The participants were considered to be sufficiently large to give researchers sufficient data, she said.During the two-year experiment, participants would be left in peace to avoid affecting the study or they way they behave , she said.One participant, Juha Jarvinen, from the small town of Kurikka in western Finland, told Finnish public broadcaster YLE he was happy to be part of the experiment, and planned to relaunch his small business that went under five years ago. The period after the bankruptcy was hard and there were waiting periods to get different benefits, he said, adding that the experience had raised the threshold to accept short-term jobs .Heikki Hiilamo, professor of social policy at Helsinki University, Norway, told dpa the programme targets people who have not had an opportunity to get a traditional permanent position in the labour market .He noted that the participants in this scheme are not sanctioned .This means if they are not willing to participate in active labour market policy measures, like education or rehabilitative work, they do not lose their cash benefit . as opposed to others who lose their benefit if they refuse an offer .When asked about the risk that the benefit could pacify its beneficiaries with free money, Hiilamo said he believed it was likely that those in the experiment group would be more active in the labour market.Finland s social welfare office will check tax records and other registries as well as employment benefit services to ensure that participants comply with the programme. Basic income is also not eligible for recipients who stay outside Finland longer than 30 days.The Nordic country, a member of the euro zone, has in recent years struggled with weak economic growth in the wake of the financial crisis and a fall in exports, including to neighbouring Russia.The Finnish central bank recently predicted GDP would grow by 1.1 percent this year, mainly driven by domestic consumption.Although the labour market has seen a slight improvement, unemployment was at 8.1 percent in November, almost the same as in the same month of 2015, according to Statistics Finland.On average, unemployment benefit in Finland is 730 euros, but some payments are less, Turunen said. KELA also plans to ensure that recipients selected for the programme do not receive less than the unemployment benefit they receive.The 560-euro benefit would not be affected if the participant works a few days or more, as opposed to current systems that reduce unemployment benefit payments and discourage benefit recipients from taking on employment, Turunen said. The aim is to increase the incentive to take on a job, she said. It is incentive-based, as you get to keep the 560 euros.
