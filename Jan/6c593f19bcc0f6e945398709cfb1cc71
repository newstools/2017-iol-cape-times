Cape Town -&nbsp;Drakenstein Fire and Rescue chief Derick Damons said a fire that started in Paarl on Monday spread from the Huguenot Tunnel along the slopes to the Bain's Kloof Pass area in Wellington. &quot;This was an&nbsp;extensive area with fire aided by strong South-Easterly winds placing&nbsp;farms&nbsp;and homes on the mountains&nbsp;slopes at risk. These winds also made it impossible for helicopters to be deployed,&quot; said Damons. He said the next 24 hours would be&nbsp;crucial&nbsp;but there is hope the fire could be contained as winds died down. .@SAWeatherServic has issued #WildfireWarnings for much of Western part of the country today, with temperatures expected to peak in the 30's pic.twitter.com/cIjIEoHgLV</p> VWS Wildfires (@vwsfires) January 17, 2017 &quot;There are hot spots and flare-ups that we will be&nbsp;monitoring throughout the day. The fire is still not under control and we hope to return 137 people from two farms, once we have the blaze under control,&quot; said Damons Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell said the SAAF deployed additional resources to combat the fires in the province. The Oryx helicopters are much larger and able to deliver a bigger payload compared to the helicopters we usually rely on. We know the SAAF assistance will make a huge difference, said Bredell. Provincial traffic chief Kenny Africa confirmed the Huguenot Tunnel is open but the Du Toits Kloof pass would remain closed until further notice.
