FISHERIES giant Viking says the challenge it faces with industry s new fishing rights is to save the jobs of 179 employees, while also aiming to ensure transformation.Speaking to the Cape Times yesterday after the high court brought an interdict against the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries latest allocation of Hake Inshore Trawl fishing rights, Viking director Tim Reddell said: The provisional allocation reduced Viking s fishing rights by 70 percent. This would directly result in at least the same percentage of job losses. The challenge is not of transformation laws, but rather an allocation decision that is inconsistent with the law and in particular the constitution. Of the 27 fishing rights granted, 15 were allocated to category A applicants, who are previous rights owners, including Viking, and six had been allocated to category C, which are new entrants.Six more had been handed to category B, who are holders of rights in other fishery sectors.The department said its new criteria were in place to accommodate new entrants and, as such, proportions of fish caught by category A applicants will be adjusted according to their scores as recorded in their rights applications.The scores indicate how well the applicants have dealt with issues of transformation, local economic development and black ownership.Department spokesperson Bomikazi Molapo said: I can confirm we will reciprocate the favour and immediately appeal the decision. He said Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana would hold an official press conference to discuss the matter soon.Third respondent SeaVuna fisheries legal representative said they did not receive a copy of the judgment.The company did not intend to comment.
