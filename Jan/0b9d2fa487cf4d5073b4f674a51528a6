SIXTY-SEVEN Grade 1 children from Masiphumelele township near Kommetjie went to school with smiles yesterday after benefiting from a R40&nbsp;000 donation. The contribution, an initiative of four South African College High School (SACS) pupils, includes new school uniforms, school bags, stationery and food hampers. Adam Begg, Nishen Naidoo, Stuart MacDonald and Fabrice Nahimana worked together to equip the Grade 1 pupils with full starter packs, raising the money between September and December last year. They calculated that it would cost R470 to provide each child with pencils, crayons, scissors, erasers, sharpeners, rulers, pencil cases and exercise books.The team of four spent part of their school holidays packing the school bags with stationery. Nahimana said he knows how it feels to have nothing, as he was orphaned at a very young age during the Rwandan civil war. He and his young brothers, with the help of a neighbour, made their way to South Africa. Nahimana said giving to the needy Grade 1s was an opportunity for him to give something back and put a smile on the young faces. That really means a lot to me. He encouraged the young ones to never give up hope and that school will always be the best way to improve their opportunities. Begg said he had been taught to share his wealth by giving back to the needy. We may not be able to help everyone, but we can all help someone. Putting a smile on your faces and giving you hope is the best thing we could do. Naidoo told the Grade 1s to remember to have fun, but also to work hard as that was going to help them later in life. Aqhamile Bongo, one of the recipients, said she was happy to have received the goodies. The four pupils believe that Mandela Day, which encourages people all over the world to contribute 67 minutes of their time by contributing to needy communities, should not only happen on one day, but throughout the year.
