ANC veteran and former minister in the Presidency Essop Pahad has described the question of whether South Africa is ready for a female president as nonsensical and sexist. The only ones who put forth this question are people who are sexist. No one who is not a sexist will ask this question. It s nonsensical. I get angry that people want to even suggest such debates. Of course a woman is ready to lead. Do we question the mother s leadership role in the household and whether she is ready to lead her children? Do we ever question if a man is ready to be a president? Of course not, Pahad said.He was speaking hours after he had spent the day with his fellow comrade Ahmed Kathrada at the consulate-general of India in Parktown, Joburg.Kathrada s foundation was awarded R2 million by the government of India to continue its work geared towards a non-racial South Africa.As the race for the position of the ruling party s top position heats up, Pahad refused to be drawn on discussing names, but said level-headed leaders were imperative in carrying forwards the torch of democracy. I have been a member of the ANC for donkey s years, therefore I am disciplined And I will not comment on any particular individual. But I will, however, point out that in terms of ANC policy, it is perfectly fine to argue on the emancipation of women and how far we as a party have come, rather than be fixated on names. Nobody can deny that the issue of a female president is a critical one, but these are matters that we should tackle at the policy conference leading up to our elective conference in December, he said.
