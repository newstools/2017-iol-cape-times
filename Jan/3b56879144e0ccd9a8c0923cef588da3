THE Road Accident Fund saved billions of rand in thousands of fraudulent claims made between 2010 and last year through numerous investigations but the practice remained disturbingly widespread. The claim is contained in a recent parliamentary response, but further details provided to The Star by the RAF paint a grim picture of abuse of the fund. The RAF has also said such fraudulent claims sometimes involve complicit lawyers and RAF staff members.Tactics included attorneys buying claim documents of an injured person who would later die, then continuing to claim as if the victim was still alive, said RAF spokesperson Linda Rulashe.RAF employees also colluded with attorneys who try to convert a direct claimant to a represented one.Other schemes included: Claims lodged by people not involved in motor vehicle accidents. People involved in accidents but claiming for fictitious injuries. Claims lodged for injuries not sustained in the accident. Claims for loss of income based on false information. Claims for loss of support by people who are not dependants of the deceased breadwinner.The details emerged after the RAF, in a parliamentary response, told DA MP Darren Bergman that through internal and external investigations it had saved billions of rand being paid out irregularly.The RAF details how it saved at its highest R460 million in the 2011/2012 financial year. At its lowest, it still saved R113m in 2013/2014. In that period, 10 415 external forensic investigations had been lodged. Over 1 600 probes were lodged against RAF staff and service providers. Fraud and corruption remains a long-standing challenge for the RAF, but our commitment to eradicate it continues, said Rulashe.In the 2015/2016 financial year, 21 employees were suspended while 29 convictions were made due to internal investigations, she added. In the same year, a total of 612 fraudulent claims were detected.
