The number of pupils promoted to Grade 12 rose from 65 000 in 2015 to 108 000 in 2016, the Department of Basic Education said on Wednesday.Chief director Rufus Poliah presented the technical report on the 2016 results in Johannesburg, ahead of Minister Angie Motshekga s official announcement of the national pass rate and overall results. In 2015, we introduced a policy on progression, which basically said if a learner fails a grade twice there is no value in retaining that learner in that grade that learner should be progressed to the next grade but the important proviso is that that learner should be supported all the way, said Poliah.He said promotion of pupils even if they did not meet requirements for the next grade was an international practice. It happens in a number of countries, but we are lacking behind in that we have not put in place the needed support the learner when moved to the next grade. It is important to note that when a learner is progressed, he has to finally satisfy the requirement of Grade 12 in order to be awarded the NSC (national senior certificate). Promoting pupils was not a pass one, pass all policy he said. The method was used to avoid having frustrated learners who eventually drop out of the school system.At least 828 020 entered the 2016 Grade 12 class 674 652 of them were full=time candidates, while 153 368 were part-time candidates.Of the 674 652 candidates who entered the class of 2016, 610 178 of them registered to sit for the exams. However, a total of 64 474 of them were absent at the end or did not write, said Poliah. This includes learners absent due to ill health or a number of factors which would have prevented them from writing the exam, or learners who decided to go with the multiple examination system (for promoted learners who are unable to write all exam papers at one go). Pupils who chose the multiple exam and wrote at least four subjects would write the rest of their subjects in June, said Poliah. African News Agency
