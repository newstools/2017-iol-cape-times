A VELD fire that damaged equipment regulating Metrorail s signalling system near Woodstock Station yesterday, caused train delays of more than an hour on lines serving the southern, northern and central suburbs.The fire destroyed eight multi-core cables over 9m.This disabled the automated signalling system, said regional spokeswoman Riana Scott.Vandalism near Nyanga and Koelenhof in the northern suburbs exacerbated the situation, she said.Hundreds of passengers arrived hours late for work, after having to jump out of Cape Town-bound trains, which became stranded between Salt River and Woodstock stations.They had to walk to their places of work and other destinations in the CBD and elsewhere.Scott said: Historically, fire damage has proven notoriously difficult to repair as few components can be salvaged and repairs have to be done from scratch. Technicians have been working since 9.30am, and due to their efforts, some trains are able to proceed under manual authorisation. She discouraged passengers from disembarking from trains that are &quot;stuck&quot; in sections between stations and risking their safety by jaywalking along the railway lines.She said at least 10% of delays and cancellations in the province were due to cable theft, with 200 incidents recorded every year.The cable replacement costs amounted to millions of rands per year, but the cost of lost productivity, customer confidence and reputational damage was virtually incalculable, Scott said.Commenting on efforts to address copper cable theft, she said Metrorail is replacing all light-current copper cabling with fibre optics and that the replacement programme forms part of a national multimillion rand project. The laying of the fibre, excluding the installation of switches and configuration, amounts to R4.8&nbsp;million. We condemn copper theft which has devastating impact on the rail service. &quot;It is deplorable that for the sake of a few metres of copper cable, thousands of commuters can be severely affected.
