WESTERN Cape pupils have done the province proud again with an 85.9% pass rate, up from 84.7% in 2015 and achieving the second-highest pass rate in the country. The national matric class of 2016 has achieved a pass rate of 72.5%, up from 2015 s 70.7%, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga announced in Midrand yesterday. The top performing province was the Free State, which achieved 88.2% up from 81.6% in 2015. Then followed the Western Cape with 85.9%. Gauteng came in third with 85.1%, a slight improvement from 84.2% in 2015. Well done to the class of 2016. For the past six years, we have noted that the NSC (National Senior Certificate) pass rate has consistently been above the 70% threshold. The class of 2016 must be commended for maintaining this trend. It is the largest cohort in the history of basic education to sit for any NSC exam in the country, Motshekga said.She said the total number of candidates registered was 828 020 pupils. With the class of 2016 being the largest cohort the country has ever registered, a possibility existed that pupil performance could drop. But this did not happen thanks to the dedication and commitment of teachers, governing bodies, parents, the South African society at large, the provincial education departments, and the class of 2016 itself for rising to the challenge, Motshekga said. The Western Cape s Overberg district has been named as the top performer in the country with a 92.7% pass rate. Second is Xhariep in the Free State with 92% and Fezile Dabi, also in the Free State, with 91.8%. The number of pupils qualifying for admission to Bachelor studies is 162 374; the number of passes with a diploma is 179 619; the number of passes with Higher Certificates is 100 486; and the number of passes with NSC is 68. In 2016, a total of 158 160 distinctions were achieved. In the 12 key subjects including mathematics, physical science, accounting, economics, business studies, among others, the total number of distinctions increased to 65 154 in 2016, from 63 348 in 2015. We will be the first to concede that despite the notable improvements in the system, we are yet to cross our own Rubicon. We must agree that much has been achieved, but much more needs to be done in the area of efficiency and quality. We call upon all South Africans to work together with us to move the public schooling to greater heights, the minister said. Citing research, Motshekga said at the higher levels of performance, the patterns have been encouraging, and lend support to the finding of a system that is on the rise. In maths, 33 511 pupils achieved a mark of 60% or more in the 2016 examinations, following figures of 30 314 and 31 812 for 2014 and 2015 respectively. By far, most of the improvement has been among black African learners. For instance, the increase of 1 709 between 2015 and 2016 with respect to all learners achieving a mark of 60% or more in mathematics becomes an increase of 1 308, if one considers just black African learners only. These trends thus point to a narrowing of the serious race-based inequalities in schools, Motshekga said. On behalf of the class of 2016, we wish to extend a special gratitude to all our teachers, parents, the NGO sector, education researchers, corporate South Africa and the rest of the population for their continued support in our endeavours to bring about quality basic education in our lifetime. All hands must be on deck, Motshekga added. [email&#160;protected]
