Johannesburg Those who want to hold parties of their own in celebration of the January 8 statement are welcomed to do so but not in the name of the ANC.This is a stern warning from the ruling party.Briefing the media earlier on Wednesday about the ANC's 105th birthday bash on Sunday, head of the organising committee Fikile Mbalula said no one has been mandated to host any party in the country.&quot;We have noted reports in the media which have been to an extent exaggerated as far as being apportioned to the organising of the event.The ANC would like to state it clear and categorically that we don't decide opening times of alcohol, beer halls and their closure at any given point in time. We have no call with regards to that,&quot; Mbalula said. He was reacting to a decision by the Gauteng Liquor Board to extend special dispensation licences for the trade of alcohol at the weekend. But in a sudden turnabout, the Liquor Board said in a statement that it had decided to cancel the extension of trading hours.&quot;The GLB had been inundated with applications for extensions of liquor trading times for this weekend and upon consideration had initially decided to apply its discretion in favour of relaxing liquor trading times to promote local tourism and the hospitality industry.However, having considered feedback from the public and other key stakeholders, and after consultation with Gauteng MEC for Economic Development Lebogang Maile, the GLB wishes to announce that liquor trading times will no longer be extended for this coming weekend,&quot; the statement read.But Mbalula said: &quot;We think everything that is being done to ensure we are a healthy nation and that cautions people in terms of excessive drinking must also be equally applied as we embark and host this event in Gauteng. Any reports that associate the ANC with that to the changing of times they have nothing to do with the ANC and neither is it decided by the leadership of the movement.&quot;The ANC Women's League also reacted angrily to suggestions that times be extended. It said the January 8 statement was to reflect on the successes and challenges of the previous year adding it (the League) will not allow the event to be turned into a drinking spree.&quot; Members and supporters of the ANC attend Jan 8 statement events to listen to the President of the ANC delivering ANC NEC statement contrary to whatever is suggested by GLB narrative. The ANCWL will not allow anyone or any institution to attempt to drag the good name and credibility of the ANC in the mud,&quot; the statement read.In the meantime, Mbalula announced that a special National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting will be held on Thursday to finalise the NEC statement of the 105th celebrations. The leadership will also attend the commemoration of the passing of former ANC member, leader of the South African Communist Party and anti-Apartheid activist Joe Slovo at Avalon Cemetery Friday.Later in the day on Friday the ANC leadership will convene for an event on Vilakazi Street. A fundraising gala dinner will be held on at the Sandton Convention Centre on Saturday while a cake cutting ceremony with various NGOs will take place on Monday.Up to 800 buses are expected to transport members and supporters to Orlando Stadium where the event will be held. An overflow area will be provided at a nearby rugby stadium.Although a list of artists has yet to be released, various South African entertainers are billed to perform at the event which will also include a cultural entertainment program me about the history of the liberation movement.The event is expected to start at 10am.Political Bureau
