JOHANNESBURG: Authorities at the Kruger National Park said yesterday they were pleased with the heavy recent rains in the park and surrounding areas as this would lead to improved grazing for animals.The Park s spokesperson William Mabasa said: The heavy rainfalls has no negative impact on the animals, it s rather very advantageous for grazing and sufficient amount of water. Mabasa said the closure of the gravel roads south of the Sabie River was a precautionary measure taken to ensure visitor safety.AgriSA has asked the government to extend a helping hand to commercial and small-scale farmers to help them survive.Despite widespread rains over large parts of the country, parts of the Northern Cape, Western Cape, North West, Limpopo and the Free State provinces are still in the grip of the worst drought this decade, according to AgriSA. Farmers in certain parts of the country continue to suffer the negative effects of the drought and are struggling to survive, the group said in an appeal to the government for assistance.During the past year, AgriSA launched various initiatives to provide needy farmers countrywide with drought relief.The shortage of funds has now resulted in AgriSA being unable to provide further assistance, the group said. The time has now come for the government to provide further assistance to commercial and small-scale farmers to help them survive, said Johannes M&ouml;ller, president of AgriSA.AgriSA also called urgently on the private sector to make further contributions to its drought relief fund. AgriSA alone cannot meet the farmers needs and therefore we call urgently for financial contributions, M&ouml;ller said.Devastating drought conditions in the western parts of the country over the past three years have had a serious impact on cash flow and production credit arrangements, which in turn will increasingly affect farmers financial survival, according to M&ouml;ller.The drought also had an extremely negative effect on the socio-economic conditions of rural farming communities and the development of the rural areas, he said.AgriSA is concerned about the current welfare of farmers and farmworkers and the humanitarian impact of the drought, M&ouml;ller said. Similarly, we are concerned about the lack of stock feed to pull animals through during this time, he said.The government has rejected calls to declare the drought a national crisis .The drought currently being faced by South Africa has reached crisis point. Dam levels are down in all provinces, many of them standing at less than 50 percent of capacity, compared to 82 percent for the same time last year.This represents a major economic and humanitarian crisis as food security is placed under threat and the livelihood of those in the agricultural sector is placed in jeopardy.Due to the drought, SA, previously a grain exporter, has begun to import grain.Grain SA said the country imported about 750 000 tons of maize to meet the needs in the 2013/14 season. The 2015/16 season will see this increase to five million tons of maize.
