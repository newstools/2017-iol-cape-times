The ad hoc committee into the SABC has stuck to its guns it would finalise its report within the stipulated deadline.Chairman of the committee Vincent Smith said on Thursday during deliberations on the draft report they will have the final report by the end of February. However, the draft report will be concluded on Friday, Smith told the committee.&nbsp; He said a lot of progress has been made in the last few weeks on the report. We have deliberated over two sessions on the possible content of the draft report. We always underestimated the amount of work, he said. He said progress made in the last weeks would enable the committee to conclude the draft report on Friday. The committee has proposed that among other things that former chairman of the SABC board Mbulaheni Maguvhe would have to pay the legal bill after he challenged the inquiry in the Western Cape High Court last December. This is also the judgment of the high court that he pays the legal costs of all counsel from his own pocket. No figure has been put on the legal bill, but it is estimated at hundreds of thousands of rands. The committee has also questioned the contradictory evidence of another former SABC board chairman Ben Ngubane. The committee has until the end of February to submit its final report in the National Assembly. Political Bureau
