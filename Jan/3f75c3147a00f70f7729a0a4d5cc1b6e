Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has dismissed Oakbay Investments claim that banks shut accounts held by the Gupta-owned company because he was plotting against the family as simply scurrilous in court documents, and said it was in fact their political connections that prompted the decision.Gordhan, in his replying affidavit to one submitted by Oakbay earlier this month, said neither he, nor the Reserve Bank, influenced major banks Absa, Standard Bank, First National Bank, FirstRand and Nedbank to close the company s accounts. Connections of bankers clients with politically exposed persons trigger banks national and international legal duties. It is because each of the banks has considered itself under a legal duty pursuant to the international and domestic statutory instruments applying to it that Oakbay s accounts were closed. The affidavit was submitted on Monday, and is the latest submission in a legal battle that began last year when Gordhan asked the Pretoria High Court for a declaratory order that he was under no obligation to intervene on Oakbay s behalf after banks closed the company s accounts.Gordhan said Oakbay s attack on him in its affidavit made no sense, in that had it been true he was politically plotting against the company, it would never have approached him for help after the banks shut its accounts. Had Oakbay honestly considered that I had orchestrated a concerted campaign against it, Oakbay would of course not have approached me for assistance, the minister added in his 103-page affidavit.Gordhan said Oakbay did not contest its political ties, nor did it dispute the Pretoria High Court s jurisdiction to grant the relief for which he had asked. He noted that Oakbay had confirmed on Friday that it saw no contested legal issue here and argued that it therefore could not oppose the order he has sought from the court. The company s answering papers to Gordhan's founding affidavit included a reference to him as weak-kneed and an argument that his application rested on flawed reasoning.In his founding affidavit, Gordhan revealed that payments totalling R6.8 billion made by the Gupta family and companies they controlled in 72 transactions had been flagged as suspicious by finance authorities. He asked the banks to provide confidential reports made to the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) in open court so that Oakbay s claim that they had acted improperly could be tested. In the affidavit submitted on Monday, Gordhan reiterated that Oakbay had asked him to approach the banks in the national interest .He said he was serving the national interest by approaching the court in a bid to protect the integrity of the country s finance and banking sectors and the economy at large. The minister said he asked for &quot;the determination of a pure question of law&quot; yet Oakbay had responded with &quot;wide-ranging and extraneous&quot; allegations of fact.He went on to suggest it was ironic that Oakbay had accused him of having a political motive when the owners of the company stood accused themselves of improperly meddling in government decisions. Yet it is Oakbay that, the public protector has found, influences political appointments. Since his return to the finance portfolio just more than a year ago, Gordhan has found himself in a position of objecting to numerous government contracts awarded to companies linked to the powerful family. In the case of the Eskom coal contract given to Tegeta Exploration, it led to a highly public spat with former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe, who quit his post following former public protector Thuli Madonsela's damning observations about the utility's relationship with the family in her final &quot;State of Capture&quot; report.Gordhan's stated determination to prevent state resources flowing to patronage networks has been interpreted as a power struggle between him and President Jacob Zuma, and his position within the government is considered to remain tenuous as he prepares the second national budget of his new term, though fraud charges brought against him last year were soon withdrawn and he is widely credited with averting a further credit rating downgrade.The minister dismissed the criminal charges relating to the early retirement and subsequent re-employment of senior SA Revenue Service official Ivan Pillay as &quot;political mischief&quot;.It was reported on Sunday that Molefe may soon be sworn in as an MP to allow his ascension to a cabinet post, potentially Gordhan's.
