Cape Town A Malmesbury police officer, whose body was discovered after he went missing on Christmas Eve, was having sex with prostitutes when he was killed, court documents have revealed.Warrant officer Deon Dumas body was found at a house in Witsand, Atlantis, on December 29. Police have arrested six people in connection with the murder, including two prostitutes and a teenage boy.National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said four of the accused confessed to the crime.Dumas, 57, who lived alone, had gone to drop off a Christmas gift for his mother s doctor in Malmesbury on Christmas Eve. That was the last time he was seen alive.Prosecutors say the two sex workers had lured Dumas into a bush and the three were having sex when three men and the teen accosted the group.It was originally believed that the cop had offered two women a lift after they claimed they were stranded, but Ntabazalila yesterday said the women had targeted him. The deceased was lured by Naydene Hill and Magerette van Wyk into the bush [in Witsand] to do business with him, he says. While they were busy, three men and the juvenile approached them and demanded money. They dragged the deceased out of the car into a decayed house nearby [and] tied his hands behind his back. It seems that the deceased was suffocated. They tried to sell the car in Khayelitsha. They were arrested when the police spotted the car driven in Atlantis. Four of the six accused made confessions. The minor has been moved to a place of safety, while the other five, Hill, Van Wyk, Thobinceba Mditshane, Mateo Nero and Mzondeleli Dasheka, have been remanded into custody after their bail was denied last week.On Wednesday, when the Daily Voice asked Dumas brother, Andr&eacute;, about the fact that he had solicited prostitutes, he sighed and said: My brother was a good man and would not hurt a fly. The accused will appear in the Atlantis Magistrate s Court on February 2. Daily Voice
