DEPUTY National Director of Public Prosecutions Nomgcobo Jiba and Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit head Lawrence Mrwebi were given a lifeline yesterday when they received the go-ahead to appeal against being axed as advocates.The pair can thank Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, Judge Wendy Hughes, as she found the matter was in the public interest and the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein should take another look at the issues.Judge Hughes said both Jiba and Mrwebi said they had at all times acted in good faith and were merely exercising their duties under the auspices of the NPA Act when they took several high-profile decisions.This included the decision to drop fraud and corruption charges against suspended crime intelligence head, Richard Mdluli.Judge Francis Legodi, who together with Judge Hughes, ordered the pair be struck from the roll last September stuck to his guns and said the pair were not fit and proper persons to serve the advocates profession. I am not convinced that there are compelling reasons to justify the granting of leave to appeal I also do not think that there are reasonable prospects of success on the factual findings made regarding the complaints levelled against the applicants and the severity of the proven facts, Judge Legodi said.He added he would have refused leave to appeal if it was not for the conflicting judgment by Judge Hughes.While he made it clear that he did not agree with her judgment, the judge said he was compelled to grant leave to appeal under these circumstances.Judge Legodi in his judgement yesterday said the decision to strike their names from the roll of advocates was mainly based on their handling of the Mdluli case and they were found not to have acted in good faith on a number of complaints levelled against them. The highest possible degree of good faith was required of any officer of the court and a person who offended could not expect his or her name to remain on the roll of advocates simply because they are in public service, the judge said.
