Thuli Madonsela has again called for a commission of inquiry into state capture reports to once and for all prove or disprove whether companies aligned to the Guptas and President Jacob Zuma controlled the country.The ex-public protector told the Cape Town Press Club yesterday that, based on her probe into the state capture allegations, she had started questioning who really ran this country.Madonsela was discussing with guests her experiences during her time at the helm of the Chapter 9 institution for the past seven years. Madonsela said one of the most important things the government needed to do was to bridge the gap of mistrust between the state and its people.She said the setting up of a commission of inquiry into claims that the Gupta family had undue influence over the government was a good place to start. This follows claims by Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas and former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor that they had been offered cabinet posts by the Guptas. Madonsela said that without the commission, the country might never know if those allegations were false. In her opinion, the inquiry would provide an open, transparent platform to finally clarify whether there was undue influence by the Guptas in appointing cabinet ministers or board members to state-owned enterprises.Zuma was too heavily implicated in the matter to appoint the commission s head, she added.
