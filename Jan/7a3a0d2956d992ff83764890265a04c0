THE Cape Town city centre came alive with the sound of music as the first instalment of this year s Open Streets events kicked off yesterday.Longmarket Street was included this year in the overall event, as people from all over town took advantage of the warm weather to come out and enjoy the city centre on foot.Inspired by similar programmes in South America, Open Streets Cape Town began in 2012 with the aim of decreasing the number of motor vehicles, much like other campaigns from around the world promoting car-free streets.Khayelitsha residents Norma Yeko and her partner Siweli Mabala attended for the first time, with their 2-year-old daughter Sethu Yeko in tow. I didn t even know this event existed until my partner brought this to my attention and we didn t need much convincing after that. Our daughter is enjoying the people, the sounds and activities very much and the atmosphere is just so festive, said Yeko.Mabala nodded in agreement before running off after two younger family members, who had got bikes from one of the vendors and ridden off in excitement.The numbers in attendance grew visibly larger during the course of yesterday, with visitors probably attracted by the sounds and scents which filled the air.Beverly Rodgers and her two daughters Shane and Robynne, from Somerset West, were attending for the second time and were rollerskating up Bree Street. It s fun but tiring as it s uphill. We plan to take advantage of the fact that we are coming downhill later. My daughters and I just enjoyed it so much last year and this year it s gotten even better, said Rodgers.She said she would later dance to some salsa if they could help her with her two left feet.There were salsa dancers at Smak restaurant giving quick lessons and performing to the sounds of Latin music.The managing director of Open Streets Cape Town, Marcelo Guerrero Casas, believes the event has grown beyond its initial concept. We are creating a network that one day will stretch from Cape Town all the way to Observatory, but we ll slowly build towards that. Cape Town has a wealth of cultures and diversity that today (yesterday) is fully on show and gives everyone a taste of what this City has on offer, said Casa. The eventual goal was to develop Open Streets as a popular culture which all Capetonians could be part of.
