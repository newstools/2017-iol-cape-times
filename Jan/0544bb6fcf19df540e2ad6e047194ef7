LANGEBAAN resident Liam Christian Ferreira has issued an apology after taking to Facebook and calling for a mosque in the West Coast town to be burnt down. I think it s a crime that no one is sanding (standing) up to those Muslim bastards blaring their call to pray 5 times a day over massive speakers. Why do I need to put up with an Arabic tradition created in the dessert (sic) thousands of years ago. Stand up for yourselves!!! Burn it down!!! (sic). Ferreira wrote the message on a Langebaan community Facebook page on Monday.He took issue with the Athaan (Islamic call to prayer), but has since removed his post, which was shared numerous times on social media.On another Facebook timeline, Ferreira apologised for his actions. He said he had submitted a formal apology through intermediaries to the leadership of the mosque. I have been informed that the apology has subsequently been accepted. I have issued a personal apology to anyone who has taken offence in the form of a comment on one of the main threads. I have also endeavoured to reply to as many messages sent to me as I can with the same apology, and have entered into discussion with many people. That is all. Former Langebaan resident Bradley Ruiters shared a screenshot of comments from another group over the same thread, citing racism and the mindset of the richest . One person asked if there were no by-laws against it (Athaan), as with barking dogs, and if it could not be invoked .Langebaan Mosque chairperson Nawaal Nakidien said: We as a community will come together in the coming days to discuss the matter as we do not want to respond on this emotionally. It is too early to say much of anything at this time, and we will communicate our official response in due time. He hadn t received a direct apology.Langebaan Ratepayers Association secretary Frans Palm said he was unaware of any complaint regarding the call to prayer. He said comments could not be viewed as the opinion of the community.
