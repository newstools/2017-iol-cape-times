ALTHOUGH the water situation in the province is not yet at a crisis level, consumers were urged by Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell to assist the authorities in using water responsibly.In providing an update of the water situation, Bredell expressed concern that the average water level for dams across the province had fallen to below 40%. It is massively concerning to see dam levels on average at 39.4%. We are still some way off our rainy season and therefore we once more call on consumers to assist us in using water responsibly, he said.He explained that despite the hard work done by the authorities to reduce water consumption, water use remained high and dam levels kept falling fast. We are constantly monitoring the situation and municipalities are implementing additional measures, including restrictions and tariff increases where necessary, he said.He emphasised that despite some areas having been declared disaster areas over the past year, the water situation in the province was not yet at a crisis level.Latest data provided by the National Department of Water and Sanitation regarding Western Cape dam levels include that Cape Town system dams combined were 39.90% full this week, 42.03% last week and 50.36% at corresponding time last year.The Western Cape State dams were 39.40% full this week, 41.27% last week and 48.48% at this time last year.
