She does not want it (alcohol) and she does not consume it. If it were all up to her, South Africa would not be drinking, there would be no advertising. Before having her say about the minister, she said they were accused of dancing for our food when talking about what they know about any leader who may be unpopular. So today, allow me to dance for my food. Above all allow me to be vulgar. Anyone of you who wish to use this post for your articles, go the f*** ahead! Yes, the f*** ahead.

I have decided to take this alcohol matter to the gutter where you have taken it. If you have said that Bathabile drinks, I say that your mother is the whore of the town. You can identify an alcoholic because your mother is one, she said. &quot;Lumka Oliphant&quot; was trending on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon. Cape Times
