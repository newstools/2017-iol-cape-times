The ANC on Wednesday distanced itself from the Gauteng Liquor Board's controversial decision to extend trading hours during the party's 105th birthday celebrations at the weekend.ANC's head of campaigns Fikile Mbalula said that the party had no authority or influence over the provincial government entity, the Gauteng Liquor Board, on whether to extend liquor trading hours.&quot;We have noted reports in the media, which have been to a certain extent exaggerated, as far as them being apportioned to the organising of our event. The ANC would like to state clear and categorically that we do not decide on opening times of alcohol, beer, hops and their closure at any given time, and we have got no call with regard to that,&quot; Mbalula said.&quot;We think that everything that is being done to ensure that we are a healthy nation, and caution our people in terms of excessive drinking, must also equally apply as we embark and host this particular event in Gauteng. Any report that associate ANC with regard to the changing of times with regard to selling of alcohol and accessibility have nothing and neither are they prescribed by the leadership of the movement.&quot;Mbalula was briefing the media about the party's preparedness of its 105th birthday celebrations this weekend. The Gauteng Liquor Board decided to grant, and later revoke, a special dispensation liquor license to extend trading hours during this weekend in a bid to promote local tourism and hospitality industry.There was public outrage to the decision announced on Tuesday, with various stakeholders, including the ANC Women's League, voicing their displeasure and the ANCWL warning that it would not allow the party's &quot;January 8&quot; historic event to be turned into a drinking spree.Mbalula also warned ANC-deployed provincial government officials to desist from making any statements that would bring the party into disrepute.&quot;We have advised our colleagues in government to act cautiously, particularly those who are deployed, to veer away from anything that seeks to bring the name of the African National Congress into disrepute because the ANC is the organisation that cares,&quot; Mbalula said.Outlining plans for the weekend, Mbalula said there would be 800 buses expected to shuttle supporters and members to the Orlando stadium in Soweto, from various pick-up points already identified across Gauteng.The neighbouring provinces of North West, Limpopo and Free State have also confirmed their attendance, as well as ANC's fraternal friends which are former liberation movements in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region and representatives from BRICS countries.The 105th birthday celebrations kick off on Thursday with a special National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting to finalise the January 8 Statement.On Friday there is scheduled to be an event at Vilakazi Street in Soweto, followed by a gala dinner on Saturday night at the Sandton Convention Centre which will be addressed by President Jacob Zuma.Zuma is also set to deliver the main message on Sunday at the rally at Orlando Stadium, with Mbalula saying the message would speak about self-introspection, reflection and charting the way forward for the movement.
