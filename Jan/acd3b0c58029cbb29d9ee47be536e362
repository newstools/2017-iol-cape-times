THREE local matric stars joined Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga in Midrand yesterday where they were honoured for their outstanding achievements. Hannah Clayton of Rustenburg Girls High School, Christine Vivier, of De Kuilen High School and Conrad Strydom of Hermanus High School were among the 22 top achievers from across the country who joined Motshekga at the announcement of the matric results. Hannah said consistent hard work throughout the year had paid off for the group. It was a big surprise. I felt the pressure, I knew how important these final exams would be, the 18-year-old from Pinelands said. She now needs to decide whether she will study a BSc at UCT or Stellenbosch this year. Rustenburg Girls deputy principal Susan Schnetler described Hannah as an exceptional pupil who consistently achieved an aggregate of 95 percent or more. Christine, also 18, said it was overwhelming being part of the group of top matriculants. I still can t believe I m here. I did not expect this at all. Christine, who does fencing, intends to study medicine at Stellenbosch University. It is a fantastic achievement. She is a wonderful child, humble and down to earth, De Kuilen principal Herman Mellet said. Conrad said: I believe in the importance of setting goals for what you want to achieve and striving to reach them. My parents and Hermanus High School staff played a huge part in my achievements. Hermanus High School principal Greg Hassenkamp praised Conrad's work ethic.
