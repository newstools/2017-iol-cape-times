The ANC Women's League (ANCWL) on Thursday called for a probe into the affairs of South African Airways (SAA), which it accused of corruption and failure to transform to include more blacks and women in senior positions and in its dealings. &quot;ANCWL calls for a judicial commission of inquiry or a Parliament Inquiry to investigate various disturbing allegations of corruption and anti-transformation at SAA,&quot; the league said in a statement issued by secretary-general Meokgo Matuba.</p> The league said, of the 225 senior captains employed by SAA, 217 are white males, four black males and four white females.&nbsp; It said the employment inequity was repeated in other ranks as well.&nbsp; &quot;The ANCWL has noted alarming reports that suggests that SAA is facing internal and external forces who are doing all within their powers to fight any attempts to transform SAA particularly on procurement and employment equity,&quot; the league said.</p> &quot;This is done consciously to continue with only white-owned suppliers being major beneficiaries of tenders at SAA. It is also a plan to ensure that only male occupies senior positions at SAA.&quot; Read also: Bain to pilot SAA, Mango merger The ANCWL claimed that for about 82 years the same five companies have supplied SAA with jet fuel, which it said was an anomaly. &quot;SAA is not flying to Florida in the USA but there are workers (ghost) in SAA books and call centre at Florida (US). This also extendS beyond Florida-USA but to various countries,&quot; said the league. The ANCWL also claimed that retired and resigned pilots from SAA were still receiving SAA benefits even after being employed by other airlines. The league said it will persuade the ANC-led government to compel all state-owned enterprises &quot;through legislation&quot; to do business only with suppliers that have more than 50% black women ownership. SAA could not be immediately reached for comment.
