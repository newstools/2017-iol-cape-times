Eskom on Wednesday decided to postpone the scheduled interruption of bulk electricity supply to defaulting municipalities in the Free State and North West to mid-January. This comes after AfriForum and AfriBusiness applied for an urgent interdict at the North Gauteng High Court against Eskom on Wednesday, to stop the utility cutting electricity to municipalities that had outstanding electricity bills. The organisations argued that this move was unconstitutional as it would affect ordinary citizens and that there were other ways to recover the money. The planned power cuts were initially planned for Thursday. The seven affected municipalities in the Free State are Tokologo, Nketoana, Nala, Mantsopa, Masilonyana, Dihlabeng and Moqhaka. The three municipalities in North West are Naledi, Mamusa and Ventersdorp. After careful consideration of the impact of the public holidays over the festive period, and the commitment made in court today during the AfriForum case, Eskom has decided to postpone the interruption of supply to these municipalities from 5 January, 2017 to 16 January, 2017, Eskom said. This will allow all impacted stakeholders more time to prepare accordingly. Eskom said it hoped that the affected municipalities would use this opportunity to make payment arrangements. Last year, Eskom nearly cut the bulk electricity supply to the top 20 defaulting municipalities in a bid to recover R3.68 billion owed to it. African News Agency
