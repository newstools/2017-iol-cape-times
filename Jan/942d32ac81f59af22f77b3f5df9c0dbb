Three armed men went on a robbery spree, stealing from five informal traders on Thursday, and when barber Mohammed Walufimbi tried to intervene, he was shot dead.Walufimbi, 32, died trying to stop the robbers. Informal traders selling goods along Delft Main Road have experienced 20 armed robberies in two weeks. The suspects remain on the loose.The crimes have apparently been committed by the same individuals, who, according to the community, target foreign-born vendors. Guns and knives are used by groups of two or three at a time, claim the traders. It was not the first time the suspects had robbed Walufimbi, said his friend Howard Kangombe. Walufimbi, the breadwinner of his family, was busy with customers when the three robbers approached and pointed a firearm at him. They demanded money. But he would not comply with their demands. He fought back, clutching the firearm. He was shoved and then shot once, fell to the ground. He died at the scene.Police spokesperson Andre Traut said Walufimbi had been accosted by the three suspects after they robbed the hardware store next door to his barber shop. The deceased grabbed the firearm-wielding man, and a scuffle unfolded. A shot went off, said Traut. He said the robbers fled with an undisclosed amount of cash and had yet to be arrested. Cases of murder and business robbery were being investigated.Kangombe said traders were living in fear. It is disappointing that police had not acted on the suspects although they are known to the traders and live nearby. &quot;The police station is less than 100m away... several robbery complaints have been lodged. &quot;Mohammed had had enough and fought back. &quot;He paid with his life, but he died fighting for what is right, said Kangombe.Cape Times
