The tour guide killed in a crocodile attack at Le Bonheur Crocodile Farm in Paarl at the weekend has been described as a friend to many and a mentor to thosewho worked with him. The farm s management expressed its deepest condolences to Johann Burger s family, saying his death came as a huge shock . On Saturday morning at approximately 8.50am we lost a very dear colleague in a tragic and fatal accident which occurred in one of our crocodile ponds at Le Bonheur Crocodile Farm. We would like to issue heartfelt thanks to everyone who has since offered their support; it is greatly appreciated during this traumatic time, the farm management said. Le Bonheur said the incident will be investigated and Le Bonheur will provide further details. Johan was known for his extensive knowledge of botany and landscaping, as well as his impressive rendering skills and portfolio of wildlife murals in many animal parks in southern Africa. During the times he assisted with guiding, his informative talkswere received very positively, and it added valuable content to the guided croc pond tour, said Le Bonheur. It is hard to envision the way ahead without his input; his projects (are) concrete around us, and his dreams for future projects still alive in our minds. We remain grateful for his time shared with us, and will honour his work and his ethos in our daily lives. The 54-year-old Burger joined the Le Bonheur team on a part-time basis as designer and executor of display areas in and around the crocodile ponds toward the end of 2015, and also as tour guide during the December holiday season. Police have said an inquest has been opened for investigation.
