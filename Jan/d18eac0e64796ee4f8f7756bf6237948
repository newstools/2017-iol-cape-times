MASIPHUMELELE residents living in RDP houses are angry that rubbish is piling up in front of their homes and streets without collection or cleaning by the City of Cape Town since December. Residents living in an informal settlement in the area also complained that the stink coming from the canals causes flies and maggots to infest their homes, resulting in sickness. The residents say they have unsuccessfully tried several times to alert the city. Sylvia Mgijima, 32, whose house is situated right next to piles of rubbish, said the city was ignoring her complaints. There are various sorts of stinking material including dead animals and rotten food all over the streets and children play next to it. This is disgusting, she said. Activist Rosemary Milbank said the community was furious with the rubbish that has been piling for weeks. Children are playing in the sewerage contaminated water which is also full of maggots . The City s spokesperson Priya Reddy said a contractor responsible for cleaning parts of Masiphumelele terminated its contract at the end of December and a new contractor will commence on February 1. Reddy said the City s Solid Waste Management Department provides ad hoc cleaning services in the interim.Mayoral committee member for transport, Brett Herron appealed to residents to refrain from dumping waste in the canals .
