THE legal representative for 27 Woodstock residents facing eviction from their Bromwell Street homes, yesterday argued in the Western Cape High Court that there were a number of vacant plots in the area on which the city could accommodate them.The city plans to relocate the people including children to an incremental development area in Wolwerivier, which the residents have rejected, saying it was far from schools, health care facilities, and transport nodes.Advocate Sheldon Magardie said the applicants had identified vacant plots in Woodstock and Salt River that were suitable for their relocation. The city is under a constitutional duty to provide the residents and their dependants residing with them with temporary emergency housing in a locality as near as possible to the area in which they currently reside,&quot; Magardie said. The city has failed to grapple with the actual situations of the residents and has failed and/or refused to consider any alternative measures other than providing the residents with emergency housing units at Wolwerivier. The city s response to the emergency housing needs of the residents is inflexible, unreasonable and unconstitutional.&quot;The Woodstock Hub bought the Bromwell Street houses in 2013, and instituted eviction proceedings during July 2015.According to court papers, the property development company wants to construct middle income units for rent between R5 000 and R9 000 a month.Many of those living in the houses earn R3 500 a month or less, and last year an eviction suspension order was granted.Advocate Karrisha Pillay told the court that Wolwerivier was the closest to the CBD that the city could accommodate the residents.Judge Leslie Weinkove asked what alternatives there were, and Pillay replied Blikkiesdorp a temporary relocation area near Delft where people have been living in corrugated iron units for the last 10 years. The city has gone to great lengths to place the residents and keep them updated, that s why it organised a visit to Wolwerivier last year, Pillay said.The case continues today. francesca.villette@inl.co.za
