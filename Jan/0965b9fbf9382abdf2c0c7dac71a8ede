Johannesburg Despite a dismal and embarrassing social media campaign, ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa believes the hashtag #WeAreANC which trended on Twitter has been a huge success for the ruling party.&quot;When we began this hashtag we wanted to start a robust conversation about the birthday of the ANC. It (#WeAreANC) exceeded our expectations. Whether positive or negative the ANC achieved its goal of highlighting its values and beliefs,&quot; Kodwa said.He highlighted that he was fully aware that the ruling party's brand had been dragged through the mud since the campaigns began on Monday but said they weren't expecting the to sing their praises.

It's things they have seen within the ANC and we cannot hide it. But it's also a chance for us to self-correct. Everyone has a claim to the ANC. We are a people's party. For us, criticism is construction,&quot; he said. #WeAreANC We despise the constitution and protect #Zuma in his abuse. pic.twitter.com/J4IILWTEAI#WeAreANC We despise the constitution and protect #Zuma in his abuse. pic.twitter.com/J4IILWTEAI QvERR (@QVER_Newsday) January 3, 2017</blockquote> Kodwa and others tried to quell the criticism by posting a positive message about the January 8 celebrations and about the ruling party.He tweeted: &quot; I look forward to furthering this conversation about the future of our country and its leadership in a constructive manner #WeAreANC.&quot;But users were unrelenting and continued to berate the party for its failure to transform the country and lead its citizens with dignity.#WeAreANC TweetsEconomic Freedom Front spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi tweeted: &quot;#WeAreANC and we always lie to parliament.&quot;braSbu in the meantime wrote: &quot;#WeAreANC We lie.
