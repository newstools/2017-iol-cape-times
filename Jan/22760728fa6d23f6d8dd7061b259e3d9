Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde has announced that measures have been put in place to repair a section of the canal which funnels water from the Clanwilliam Dam to farms in the area.Winde said a temporary steel structure had been erected to stem water losses at a severed section of the canal which resulted in the disruption of water supply to about 45 000 residents and 15 000 hectares of irrigation from Tuesday to Saturday last week.Winde said that the Western Cape Department of Agriculture visited the site last Friday. The section of the canal broke due to an electronic malfunctioning of the telemetry system which controls the water level in the canal. This resulted in an overflow at the concrete canal section which washed away the soil supporting the canal lining. A temporary steel structure was installed to replace the broken canal lining. This temporary structure will be replaced by concrete lining during the annual maintenance period in winter. Under the National Water Act, the Lower Olifants River Water Users Association (Lorwua) was responsible for the maintenance and management of the infrastructure.Winde commended the association for their efforts to resolve the matter. Lorwua and the contractor they appointed, Namakwa Engineering, took swift action under a high-pressure situation. They worked tirelessly, 24 hours a day, until the water supply was restored. The Western Cape Department of Agriculture is halfway through a R4 million proactive maintenance plan on the Clanwilliam dam canal system. Three specific stretches of the canal were identified as critical due to the aging of the infrastructure, with some being more than 80 years old. Pro-active maintenance is being carried out on these sections over a three year period. &quot;Due to prompt action, the economic impact of the damage was lessened, and we ve been able to avoid any serious loss of revenue or jobs or damage to crops, said Winde.
