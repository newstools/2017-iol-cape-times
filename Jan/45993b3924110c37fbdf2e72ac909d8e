QUEEN Mary 2 (QM2) sailed into Table Bay Harbour yesterday on a brief, two-day visit to the Mother City. Her epic circuit encompasses a route this year that will include 10 maiden visits which means nearly a quarter of her ports of call will welcome Queen Mary 2 for the first time.Now in her 14th year, she is the world s only operational ocean liner (not to be confused with a cruise liner) and was originally constructed for Cunard in 2002, replacing the ageing Queen Elizabeth 2. As an ocean liner, she is very different in construction to a typical cruise ship, having, among other things, a much sharper bow and four stabilisers as opposed to two.A lavish &pound;100 million remastering took place in 2016. The plush refit has extended the ship's life by another decade and has magnificently transformed the vessel s ultra spacious interior that is reminiscent of the golden age of Transatlantic travel. 1 310 luxurious staterooms comprise standard cabins, penthouses and deluxe apartments complete with butler and concierge services and, in some instances, private elevators and gymnasiums. With a 1 000 seater state-of- the-art theatre, the largest library at sea, a 360-degree promenade deck, casino, traditional British pub, ballroom, nightclub, art gallery, five swimming pools and a 3D cinema that morphs into the first at-sea planetarium, there is no shortage of leisure options. Eleven restaurants with 150 chefs showcase 343 wine labels, and offer passengers menus that range from healthy to hearty, light to haute cuisine, and an English high tea. The ship also has a very impressive green policy.Queen Mary 2 stands 23 storeys high, with 17 decks rising 200m above the waterline. She is four football fields in length, with a 3.5 acre footprint, is more than twice as long as the Washington Monument (167m), 147 feet longer than the Eiffel Tower is tall (300m), more than three times as long as Big Ben s Westminster Tower (95m) and as long as 36 double- decker London buses (9.5m each).This particular cruise journey continues onwards to Port Elizabeth, Mauritius, Reunion and culminates in Australia in April.For up to 3 010 guests at capacity, a voyage on Queen Mary 2 is certain to create unforgettable memories.www.whitestar.co.za
