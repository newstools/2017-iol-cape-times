BAD credit ratings and a criminal record came back to haunt some of the candidates interviewed for possible appointments to the National Youth Development Agency s board.Yesterday, 13 candidates appeared before Parliament s ad hoc committee set up to nominate candidates for consideration to serve on the NYDA board.Having shortlisted 14 candidates, the committee interviewed only 13 after ANC Youth League deputy president Desmond Moela s eleventh-hour withdrawal. The league s Mlondi Mkhize said the reason for the withdrawal was because Moela was needed at headquarters as he was part of the delegation involved in drafting policy documents for the ANC s policy conference in June.Mkhize added that the second reason was because they had earmarked Moela for another position.Yesterday, the committee listened as the candidates described why they deserved to serve on the NYDA s board. They had to answer questions from MPs relating to their understanding of the role of the agency as stipulated in the act, and what they would do to improve the quality of work rendered.These included former board chairperson Yershen Pillay and his deputy Kenneth Morolong, along with Joy Maimela, Zandile Myeni, Zandile Majozi, Siyaduma Biniza, Sifiso Mtsweni, Thembinkosi Josopu, Ndomiso Mokako, Bavelile Hlongwa, Andile Biyela, Zilondiwe Goge and Siyabonga Magadla.Towards the end of the process, co-chairperson of the committee Philemon Mapulane asked certain members to explain the findings by the State Security Agency following security checks on each candidate.The IFP's Majozi was informed that security checks revealed that there were three negative credit records against her name.Majozi said she was aware of two of the three matters. I don t have anything with Vodacom, I don t even use the network, but the other two have been resolved for the past two years.&quot;Next was Magadla, the NYDA s former spokesperson, with R473 owed to Vodacom.Magadla said he was aware of the matter, which had been a misunderstanding over the term of a contract with Vodacom, but that it had been resolved. Myeni, an educator by profession, from KwaZulu-Natal,was questioned about a criminal conviction for assault.She said it occurred in 2009 when she was a student. During demonstrations she had to defend herself against three men who had pushed her.Another candidate, Biyela, was asked to explain a record for a FNB loan of more than R55 000. He explained that he was aware of the record and said he was in the process of trying to have the credit matter resolved.
