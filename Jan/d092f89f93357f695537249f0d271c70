He added that there were reports of damage to property. Bosman said the cause of the fire was unknown. He said once the fires had been extinguished, we will turn our attention to determining the cause and whether anyone should be held accountable . The fires are definitely a concern as we cannot rule out the possibility that they may have been set deliberately. Also, the fires pose huge safety and health risks to affected residents as well as potential economic and financial risks. More than that, it puts huge strain on firefighting resources.
