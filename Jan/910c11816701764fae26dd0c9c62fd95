Labour federation Cosatu has issued a stern warning to North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo, urging him to stop interfering in matters outside of his mandate. This comes after the ANC provincial chairperson allegedly planned to unilaterally slash the salaries of public servants in an effort to turn around the province s financial situation.Yesterday, Cosatu and some of its affiliated unions, such as the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union and SA Democratic Teachers Union, criticised the plan, and did not rule out mass action if public servants were ill-treated and seen as scapegoats for the dire economic situation in the country .Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla called on Mahumapelo not to violate the Basic Conditions of Employment Act by undermining collective bargaining agreements.Pamla said that if the premier was genuinely concerned about the financial situation of the province, he should lead by example by volunteering to reduce his salary and donate a portion of it to the poor and vulnerable in the province.He added that Mahumapelo needed to focus his energies on sorting out the mess of irregular expenditure that was discovered and exposed by the auditor-general last year, which amounted to R2.9 billion; and also cancel the ridiculous plans by his provincial administration to buy him a private jet . Spokesperson for the premier Brian Setswambung described the allegations as unfortunate and a complete misrepresentation. He said the provincial government understood that South Africa was not a federal state and salary negotiations are a product of collective bargaining . There is no intention on the part of the provincial government to entertain salary discussions at a provincial level. &quot;The provincial government is hard at work with efforts to implement the National Development Plan in the province and will remain focused on this important task that seeks to improve the livelihood of citizens for the better, he said.He insisted there was no financial crisis in the province. @luyolomkentane
