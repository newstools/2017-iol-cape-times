The SABC could have an interim board soon after Parliament has agreed on the five people to take over the reins after the previous board collapsed.Chairperson of the portfolio committee on communications Humphrey Maxegwana said yesterday they would convene a meeting to decide on the five names.However, he would not say how soon the process would be finalised.Currently, the ad hoc committee into the SABC is finalising its inquiry into the problems at the public broadcaster under the previous board.The ad hoc committee will call its last witnesses this Friday, and both are former chairs of the SABC. Ben Ngubane and Ellen Tshabalala will appear before MPs on Friday.The committee has until the end of February to submit its report to Parliament.Maxegwana said the issue of appointing an interim board was a priority for Parliament. In terms of the process itself, the committee will come up with five names, he said.He would not discuss the names of people to be appointed to the board as that will form part of the discussions of the portfolio committee. The question of the in- terim board is quite urgent; the sooner it s there, the sooner the SABC will start to operate, he said.The law requires that some of the decisions of the SABC must be taken with the approval of the board.The SABC has been operating without a board after all the members quit.The broadcaster has been rocked by infighting since the board was appointed in 2014.Some of its former members have given evidence before the ad hoc committee and detailed the difficult environment in which they operated, and how they were hounded out of the SABC.Former chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng has been accused by some of the ex-board members as the source of tension and infighting in the board.Maxegwana did not give the specific dates for the appointment of the interim board.In the past, the interim board was appointed for six months, after which a permanent board would be appointed.However, in the past six years no permanent SABC board has completed its full five-year term because of infighting.This has led to the intervention of Parliament to dissolve the previous boards.The infighting has been so bad at the SABC that the National Assembly amended the law to allow for the appointment of an interim board.Despite the appointment of permanent boards later, the infighting kept rocking the SABC.
