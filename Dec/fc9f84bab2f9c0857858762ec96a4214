Johannesburg - African National Congress (ANC) presidential hopeful Matthews Phosa's campaign team has withdrawn his urgent application to nullify the outcome of the disputed Mpumalanga provincial general council (PGC) which endorsed ''unity'' ahead of the party's national elective conference set to get underway on Saturday. Lawyers for the two warring Mpumalanga factions of Premier David Mabuza and Phosa reportedly opted for internal mediation. Advocate Dali Mpofu, for Ronnie Malomane who brought the application before the court, told South Gauteng High Court Judge Edwin Molahlehi that the ''parties have found each other.''  Phosa, a former ANC treasurer, wanted the Mpumalanga PGC and the branches that voted for "unity" instead of their preferred candidates be declared null void, and that the provincial executive committee is barred from attending the national elective conference. Mabuza supporters gathered outside party headquarters, Luthuli House in Johannesburg singing his praises before making their way to the court.
