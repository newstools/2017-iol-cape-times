On Wednesday provincial education minister Debbie Schäfer congratulated Western Cape Teacher, Wendy Horn, who was selected as one of the top 50 teachers in the world out of 8000 applicants. Horn, who specialises in Maths and Science Teaching, received the National Teaching Award for ‘Excellence in Teaching Science’ during March 2014 and was also the Western Cape’s Teacher of the Year Award for’ Excellence in Teaching Science’ in 2013.    Horn said being listed as one of the top 50 was a daunting accolade.  “Being selected as one of the top 50 teachers for Global Teachers Award, 2018, is both an exciting and humbling experience. It is also a little bit daunting, knowing that educators will now look up to you to inspire, mentor and lead them”, said Ms Horn. She further said:  “It is not possible to become an excellent teacher on your own. The selection for this award recognises the hard work of all the teachers that have mentored me, worked with me and have shaped me into the teacher I am today,” she said.  Horn said it is a “privilege to be able to mould young people, preparing them to be positive and active citizens of our country” saying the accolade rewards the pupils who has passed through her classroom doors. . The Global Teacher Awards is in its fourth year and has been dubbed the ‘Nobel Prize’ for teaching. The $1 million teacher’s award is the largest prize of its kind.  With over 8000 applicants from 148 countries around the world, being shortlisted in the top 50 finalists is a remarkable achievement. Horn is one of two South Africans who made the shortlist. Majorie Brown from Roedean School in Johannesburg was also shortlisted and both teachers are “certainly flying the flag for South Africa”, said Schäfer.  The Global Teacher Awards website says that “the prize was set up to recognize one exceptional teacher who has made an outstanding contribution to the profession as well as to shine a spotlight on the important role teachers play in society.”
