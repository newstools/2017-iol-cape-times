Speaking to the Cape Times hours before hundreds of people walked the streets of the CBD and visited significant sites in the fight against slavery, Bennett said there were lots of lessons to share. She said the walk would be linked to the 16 Days of Activism for no Violence Against Women and Children Campaign by encouraging others to act against abuse.  “Lots of people know there were slaves in the Cape, but don’t know how exactly they lived. Slaves influenced how we live today, what we eat and the languages we speak.” The walk started at Zonnebloem Estate, moved through District Six and ended at the Lydia Williams Centre of Memory in Chapel Street.
