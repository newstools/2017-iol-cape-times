Only months after Dudu Myeni was removed as South African Airways (SAA) board chairwoman following a string of scandals, she has landed a top job as adviser to Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi, the Sunday Times reported. The controversial appointment – which could see Myeni net more than R1 million a year – came as the government considered moving SAA from National Treasury to the transport department, the newspaper said. Maswanganyi confirmed there was a national review under way to move SAA to his department.  He also defended the appointment of Myeni, who is a friend of President Jacob Zuma, saying she had been “highly recommended”, but would not say by who.
