Suspended Eskom chief financial officer Anoj Singh will on Tuesday appear before the parliamentary inquiry into illicit dealings at the power utility, the portfolio committee on public enterprises said. The committee will also hear evidence from the Eskom board. In August, Eskom was forced to contradict Singh's assurances that there were no unauthorised payments to the Gupta family's Trillian Capital Holdings and to KPMG.  The climbdown came after New York-based consultancy Oliver Wyman denied that on review it found the payments, totalling R1.6 billion, to be above board, and said it had suggested these be subjected to legal review. Singh has repeatedly been implicated in suspect dealings with companies in the Gupta brothers' business empire by witnesses who appeared before the inquiry last month. He is said to have been central to arranging a R1.6 billion guarantee and R657 million prepayment to help the Guptas's Tegeta Exploration buy the Optimum coal mine. He was placed on special leave following pressure from Eskom's lenders. African News Agency
