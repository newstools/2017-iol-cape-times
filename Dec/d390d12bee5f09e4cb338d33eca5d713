On Wednesday Carlo de Kock and Stanton Mano made a brief appearance, when the court heard the judicare practitioner assigned to represent De Kock, accused number one, never communicated why they could not be in court. Legal Aid lawyer for Mano, Rustin Ravat said communication with the practitioner delayed the court date. “Nobody can get hold of (the practitioner). The judicare forms were accepted and they are aware of the date,” Ravat said. The State also said they were not contacted with a reason why the newly appointed lawyer would not be present. Magistrate Goolam Bawa said the “matter cannot go on like this” and suggested a new lawyer be considered to represent De Kock. The pair will return to court on December 14 and remain in custody. Both accused will apply for bail, which the State indicated they would oppose. When the duo previously appeared on November 22, Ravat said “there was a conflict of interest and a new lawyer had to be appointed for De Kock”. The two were to make a bail application at their previous appearance but the case was delayed due to a new lawyer having to be appointed for De Kock. De Kock, McCrawl’s uncle, and Mano allegedly raped and killed McCrawl before disposing of her body at the Vygieskraal riverbank in Manenberg. McCrawl was reported missing on October 19 after the diligent pupil never made it to school. Her body was found the next day. A police source confirmed traces of human blood were found in a wheelie bin and a backyard dwelling in Audrey Court, Manenberg, after her body was found. According to reports, CCTV footage aided in the successful arrests of the men, who were seen using a wheelie bin allegedly to dump McCrawl’s body. “A sniffer dog was brought in for evidence collection and it was confirmed there was human blood in the bin. Following a check of the backyard dwelling, there were also traces of human blood found in the house,” the source said.  Facebook   Twitter
