“The decision was taken in the interest of commuters and employees, and as a result of authorities’ inability to effectively deal with crime, in particular metal theft,” said Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott. “The employees of this region work under the most unenviable conditions imaginable; ankle deep in wet sewerage, in wind-swept and crime-ridden areas while armed criminals watch and make threatening gestures.  "They are ambushed, assaulted, shot at, killed and their vehicles trashed.” Scott said existing capital funding has been reassigned at the cost of other projects to fund urgent interventions to stabilise the service to the high-density Chris Hani/Kapteinsklip corridor.     The parastatal has also confirmed that some 59 procurement processes to the value of R292 million were in progress. Scott said these include but are not limited to further protection of assets and target hardening of critical and strategic infrastructure to ensure that: *  Critical components and contractors are secured to expedite maintenance;   *  Eight apparatus cases crucial to the automated signalling system are rebuilt and secured; * The completion of a secure, 3-metre-high, reinforced  concrete walling of the entire Langa-Bontheuwel-Netreg-Nyanga area to prevent unwanted ingress;   *  Reinstatement of the technology project to protect priority assets; and *  Armed guards retained to escort train/maintenance crews.
