Born in District Six,  Daniels, 89, was an activist all his adult life and spent 15 years in prison for his contribution to South Africa’s liberation struggle. After his release from prison, Daniels hatched a plan to help Madiba escape by helicopter.  The escape was planned for New Year’s morning 1981, but never came to fruition. The Nelson Mandela Foundation says Madiba referred to  Daniels as “a very honest chap” and illustrated this with an anecdote about an end of year draughts final competition in prison. Daniels became a good friend of Mandela’s during his incarceration on Robben Island’s B Section and  remained close until Madiba passed away four years ago, according to the 
foundation. “Despite the fact that Uncle Eddie had been from the Liberal Party and the African Resistance Movement while Madiba was from the ANC, they formed an unbreakable bond in prison and regarded each other as comrades, as well as friends,” said the foundation. “On behalf of our chairman Professor Njabulo Ndebele, our Board of Trustees and staff, we send our deepest condolences to his family, friends and 
comrades.” SA film-maker Anant Singh said Daniels was an exceptional human being who was one of the closest friends of Ahmed Kathrada. “Kathy introduced me to Eddie soon after I met him in the early 1990s and we became firm friends.  “Eddie enriched my and my family’s lives.  ‘‘My admiration for Eddie’s joie de vivre grew as he, in his 80s, embarked on an Antarctic expedition, went skydiving and walked the Great Wall of China,” he said.  Ahmed Kathrada Foundation executive director Neeshan Balton said: “We extend our condolences to the family and friends of Comrade Eddie, whose legacy we are sure will inspire generations to come.  ‘‘Comrade Eddie’s passing is not only a loss to his relatives, but to South Africa as a whole. He served the country with distinction and with integrity.”
