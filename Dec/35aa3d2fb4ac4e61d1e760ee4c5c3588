Troops representing the CTMA and the rival association awarded the stadium for competition, the Kaapse Klopse Karnival Assosiasie (KKKA), were present, resulting in a police presence during proceedings. The matter came just days before the season is set to begin with the Voorsmakie parade tomorrow. In November the CTMA’s urgent application to compel the City to award them the stadium for their upcoming events was struck off the roll, with costs. Acting Judge Bruce Langa heard their arguments. Representing the CTMA, advocate Paul Tredoux said that his clients sought the court to review and set aside the City’s decision. Tredoux said there was “bias” and “collusion” by the City in refusing his client’s application and that their rights were violated in the way the City went about exercising its discretion against them. For the City, advocate Mark Greig argued that the decision the CTMA sought to have reviewed, hosting of the Athlone competitions, had not been made. He said the applicant had had ample time to register its unhappiness with the City after it was granted an opportunity to do so in June. Judge Langa adjourned the matter yesterday, saying he would make his decision as a matter of urgency based on the seriousness of the matter. The case will resume on Tuesday.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
