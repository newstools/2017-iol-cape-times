The Women Political Leaders Global Forum is a  global network of female politicians. The mission of the forum is to increase both the number and the influence of women in political leadership positions.  This is coupled with the Women in Parliaments Global Forum (WIP). Since its foundation in 2013, WIP has reached out to the approximately 9 000 female parliamentarians across the world. Over 400 women political leaders from around the world met for the annual summit which took place in Iceland on Wednesday. “I am supremely honoured. Thank you to the World Political Leaders Global Forum, this award has inspired me immensely.  “I will continue to work harder to push down barriers to women’s emancipation and empowerment,” Dlamini Zuma said. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, was also in attendance as chairperson of the Council of Women World Leaders. She highlighted the World Economic Forum’s recent index which concluded men’s earnings were rising faster than those of women and said it was worrying. “This shows that even with the economy recovering - and better economic development in the world overall - the pay gap is increasing instead of diminishing,” she said. Silvana Koch-Mehrin, founder and president of the WPL foundation, said: “It is time to take a step forward. Political leadership is exercised at many levels of decision-making.  "WPL becomes the forum for women political leaders to communicate, exchange experiences and work together." According to the UN, in June 2016, only 22.8% of all national parliamentarians globally were women - up from 11.3% in 1995. Dlamini Zuma was also an advisory WPL board 
member.
