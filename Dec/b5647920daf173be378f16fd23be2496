The reserve staff were thrilled to discover a rather unexpected addition - a new baby  calf.  Born during the daylight hours of Sunday, the surprise arrival comes with its own unique story.  Female white rhinos are pregnant for about 16 months and give birth to only one calf.  The calves are weaned when they are about two years old and stay with their mother until they are about three years old.  The mother of a calf is not likely to mate with a male 
until her calf has left her to pursue its own life of independence. The surprise newborn, whose gender is still to be determined, is the second calf to the cow, who gave birth to her first calf on December 16, 2015 - almost two years ago to the day.  Her first calf, a healthy female, was still walking with her right up until Sunday’s surprise birth and for the hours preceding the arrival of her new sibling. “It has been a remarkable few years for the rhino population at Aquila”, said owner Searl Derman.  Constantly under the watchful eye of the sophisticated and experienced Anti-Poaching Unit, the increasingly thriving and growing herd is something that Aquila is proud of. It forms a major part of the conservation initiatives ensuring the strengthening 
of the gene pool and ultimately the survival of the 
species.
