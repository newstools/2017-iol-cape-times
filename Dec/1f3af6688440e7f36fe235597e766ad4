While more than 25 000 lung transplants have been performed at centres around the world, lung transplantation was only attempted at the hospital once - a unilateral lung transplant in 1993.  Bhavna Patel, chief executive at Groote Schuur Hospital, said: “The hospital is extremely proud of this achievement and continues to remain at the cutting edge of clinical care offered to patients.” The patient was a 38-year-old woman with severe airflow obstruction secondary to childhood respiratory viral infection. Groote Schuur said that following the procedure the patient was now breathing comfortably on her own with her new lungs, and so far all parameters looked promising. Upon finding a suitable donor, two members of the staff were sent abroad to learn about lung transplantation, in order to revive the programme. Greg Calligaro, a specialist pulmonologist, completed a Fellowship in Lung Transplant Medicine at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney, Australia, last year, one of the 10 high-volume lung transplant centres in the world.   Other members of the team were experienced veterans of the cardiac transplantation programme at the hospital, who had been involved in transplantation for decades. The department said that, to their knowledge, no academic centre in the country or in the rest of Africa offered this therapy to uninsured patients, which made up the majority of the population.  The hospital said the transplant would not have been possible without the donation of organs. The Organ Donor Foundation said about 4 300 South Africans were on the waiting list for organ and cornea transplants.
