Felicity Kiran and Lauren-Lee Bock recently performed in the UK, using their talents for a good cause - raising money for organ donation and a flood disaster fund. The duo, managed by David Gummers, head of DGP Music in the UK, starred in From South Africa with Love, in front of an audience of 675 people. They performed Christmas carols as well as a number of proudly South African hits, like Miriam Makeba’s Pata Pata, and Vicky Sampson’s African Dream. They managed to raise R13500 in one night for the Charity Kendal Organ donors and Cumbria Community Foundation. Bock said it was the first time they performed together internationally. “We are committed to performing, and currently we are working hard to take our music places,” Bock said. She added that their group, Woman2Woman, are currently working on performances for Cape Town. “Plans are in the pipeline, we want to do shows in Cape Town,” Bock said. Gummers said Kiran and the Holme school choir had the audience in tears with Away in a Manger. “It was truly beautiful. The contrast between Felicity and Lauren is what makes it work. "Felicity is a true performer coming from musical theatre while Lauren has the mezzo soprano voice,” Gummers said. The third singer in the Irreplaceable video, Anray Amansure, is a cast member in Marc Lottering’s full-scale musical Aunty Merle The Musical.
