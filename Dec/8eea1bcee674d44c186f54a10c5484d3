Cosatu has condemned the Metrorail line closures which left thousands of commuters stranded on Monday. Metrorail had suspended its services on Cape Town's Central line "until further notice", with no trains operating on the Chris Hani-Kapteinsklip and Bishop Lavis lines.
In a statement, the trade union said that the decision to stop operating the Metro Rail central line was unacceptable. “This is Metrorail giving up on the professional service they are obligated to do. But it is also a bigger indication that authorities are giving up on the pressures of gangsters and crime. "This will lead to the complete collapse of the central and entire Metrorail service.” The rail service confirmed that stations were closed on Monday morning and no tickets would be on sale until further notice. Metrorail also had no buses to offer as alternative transport. Signal power failure at Belville, affected the Northern line, stranding the early morning Monday commuters between station, many opting to disembark after hours of waiting. Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker said: "Vandals targeted several mini sub-stations, cables and back-up batteries over the weekend leaving us no option but to suspend services. The rate of vandalism simply outstrips the rate of repairs."  
Public Transport Voice (PTV) spokesperson Dalton Ndongeni said they were quite shocked by the actions of Metrorail towards commuters.  He said their organisation was calling for the government to institute a  commission of inquiry to see what was the real cause to the problems.While being delayed and having a monthly ticket, Norma Dunjwa said she had to pay an extra transport fee for a public taxi to work.  Carmen Simons said she paid R150 for an Uber to get to work this morning, with a Monthly Plus (ticket) in her bag. And commuter Xolisile Ganyaza said trains were turning back at Kuilsriver.   Facebook    Twitter
