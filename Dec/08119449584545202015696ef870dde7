Johannesburg - The Mpumalanga ANC has nominated Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma to take over from Jacob Zuma as ANC president.
 
The province held its provincial general council (PGC) on Friday, where unity was the theme as the hundreds of ANC delegates sang and chanted the word throughout the meeting.  The nominations from branches included 123 for Dlamini Zuma, while Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa got 117 of the nominations. 
 
A high number of branches from the four regions in Mpumalanga chose to abstain from nominating a candidate for the party's leadership. 
 
In the Ehlazeni region 82 branches chose to abstain in nominating a deputy president and 81 chose to abstain from nominating a presidential candidate. 
 
For the presidential candidate, there were 223 abstentions from the province, while all the other top positions were also dominated by abstentions.
 
For deputy president, the province's Premier David Mabuza was nominated with 185 votes. For chairperson Gwede Mantashe got 87 nominations, for secretary general Senzo Mchunu got 81 votes. Jessie Duarte was nominated for deputy secretary general with 40 nods and Paul Mashatile got 85 nominations. 
 
Most of the ballots where BGMs chose to abstain had been written "unity", which Mabuza said singles that "unity" won. 
  
The province is the second to choose Dlamini-Zuma. Earlier this week the Free State also chose her, while Ramaphosa has been nominated in the Western Cape, Northern Cape and Eastern Cape.  A number of other provinces are expected to announce their nominations this weekend.  Political Bureau
