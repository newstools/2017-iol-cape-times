Johannesburg - The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) announced on Monday, that an agreement regarding wage negotiations for the 2017/18 financial year had been reached with Communications Workers Union (CWU). "This agreement marks the conclusion of the wage negotiations with organized labour as the Broadcasting, Electronic Media and Allied Workers Union (BEMAWU) also signed the agreement last week," SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said in a statement. "Today, CWU also agreed to  receive a 4.8 percent increase in basic salary, back-dated to July 2017." SABC Acting Group Chief Executive Officer, Nomsa Philiso said,“We are happy that this matter has been finalised and both unions have called off their strike action. We had to all work together to ensure that the SABC’s mandate is not hampered by our internal issues. It was therefore important that  we meet each other half way during the negotiation period”. The SABC thanked BEMAWU, CWU and their constituencies for ensuring that an amicable solution was reached and the wage negotiations were finalised. "We also thank the dispute resolution body, the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) for mediating between the two parties and enabling a conducive environment that led us to reach this agreement."
