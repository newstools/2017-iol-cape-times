The drama began after Rhodes sought an interim interdict against the students over their involvement in protests against gender-based violence last year.  This interdict was granted and made final by the court.  The students then approached the Constitutional Court following two unsuccessful attempts at the Grahamstown High Court, High Court and Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) to appeal an interdict against them, with the ConCourt dismissing their leave to appeal application.
