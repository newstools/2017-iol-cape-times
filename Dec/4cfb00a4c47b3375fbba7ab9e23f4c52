Also sharing the stage with these artists was 17-year-old Nyota Parker, from Milnerton, who beat tough competition in the second installation of the City’s Festive Lights Challenge music video competition. Parker shot and uploaded her video and received the highest public votes out of 94 entries - walking away with R10 000 and the opportunity of performing at the festival. The message in the 17-year-old’s music - which inspires people to see beyond what is in front of them, be who they really are, and to live life meaningfully - led to her getting 46 000 “Buzz” points.  Parker is the creator of a new music genre she has named “TRAZZ©” - a mixture of Trap and jazz. The family-focused festival started at 4pm with the big switch-on moment at 8.30pm. This was followed by a colourful 3D video-mapping display that swathed the City Hall and surrounds with festive brightness. Cape Town City soccer coach Benni McCarthy was spotted in the crowd with family and friends but declined a short interview, choosing to enjoy the ambience. Music group Freshlyground sang the 2010 Soccer World Cup anthem Waka Waka and the crowd sang along. The moment the lights were eventually switched on by Mayor Patricia de Lille was met with great excitement, cheers and applause before the crowds tried to get a peek at the much anticipated laser display.    chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
