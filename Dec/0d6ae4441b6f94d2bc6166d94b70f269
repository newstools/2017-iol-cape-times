Cape Town - Commuters travelling on Cape Town's central line, which runs through Kapteinsklip, Khayelitsha and Bishop Lavis, will have to use alternative transport on Wednesday. Service on the line remains suspended after cable theft, vandalism and damage to critical infrastructure including signalling equipment earlier this week rendered it inoperable.  The cancellation of trains on Monday caused chaos for commuters, many of whom queued for hours to get other forms of public transport to and from work.

"Weekly/monthly ticket holders may use Golden Arrow Bus Services after morning peak from 08:30 onwards. No singles/returns will be sold to enable commuters to opt for alternative transport.  "Technical recovery teams continue with repairs, testing and safety checks before services can be reinstated. "Customers are encouraged to public address announcements at stations, to consult Metrorail's passenger information channels and their phones if registered to receive short message alerts and to share the information with fellow commuters," Metrorail said.   argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
