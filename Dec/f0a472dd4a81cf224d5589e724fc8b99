The 27-year-old suspect in the murder case of Unathi Sabsana has handed himself over at the Gugulethu police station "when he realised police were hot on his heels", Western Cape police said on Sunday. Twenty-seven-year old Unathi was allegedly shot dead by her boyfriend in an apparent jealous rage in the presence of family members, including her 10-year-old son, last Monday. "The suspect had been on the run since then," Brigadier Novela Potelwa said. Unathi’s father, Dumatisile, said there was a lot of anger over the murder, which happened two days before Unathi and her ex-boyfriend were supposed to have appeared in court in relation to a protection order she had filed against him. He will appear in the Athlone Magistrate's Court on Monday on a charge of murder. Detectives were expected to oppose bail.  The suspect was also wanted for a series of other crimes, Potelwa said.
