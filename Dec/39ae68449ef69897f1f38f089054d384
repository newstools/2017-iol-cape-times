With an unemployment rate of over 50% where 40% of adults in South Africa have no schooling or only primary schooling, the Salesian Institute Youth Projects has been creating opportunities for the youth at risk for more than 100 years here in Cape Town. The December holiday period is characterised by a spirit of giving. The SIYP is taking this opportunity to appeal to the greater public good, locally and internationally, to provide much needed support for hundreds of youth in great need. SIYP provides opportunities for youth at risk: training, basic education and support with employment. We provide over 40 000 meals per year, school uniforms, school supplies and much needed life skills and technical training to those youth who need extra guidance and support. Vocational training is also provided in various areas to give the youth at risk in and around Cape Town an opportunity to rise above their circumstances and become productive citizens. When we change their lens, that’s the opportunity to change their lives. Our job is to give them opportunities, to nurture and empower them. They are deserving of our full love and support and we do this work in honour of the great man, Don Bosco, whose philosophy was that human values and loving kindness will change the world. It’s Christmas, we’re asking people to dig into their hearts and their pockets and make a donation to youth who are desperately in need of help. Add just one child to your Christmas list and you will change their lives. It is that simple.
