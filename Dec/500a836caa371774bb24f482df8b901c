A taxi driver was killed when his minibus crashed into a tree in Mfuleni on Sunday morning. Paramedics say the man had to be freed from the vehicle with the Jaws of Life.  “Upon further assessment, he was found to be in a critical condition. ER24 transported the man to Groote Schuur hospital for further medical care but shortly after arriving at hospital he was declared dead,” ER24 spokesperson Ineke van Huyssteen said. Van Huyssteen said the cause of the incident was not known. In a separate incident, a driver was killed when his vehicle collided with a motorcycle in Klapmuts near Stellenbosch on Sunday morning. That incident brought the number of deaths on Western Cape roads to four for the weekend by Sunday morning. Provincial Traffic Chief Kenny Africa said a man was killed in an accident between Beaufort West and Leeu Gamka. Africa said there were four occupants in the vehicle and three people fled the scene after the accident.  “There were 17 bundles of copper  inside the vehicle,” said Africa. In another incident, a 12-year-old was killed and six people injured in a crash 15 km outside Beaufort West enroute to Aberdeen on Saturday. The driver had lost control of her vehicle after she overtook another car.  Africa said two females, three children and a baby were injured and taken to hospital.
