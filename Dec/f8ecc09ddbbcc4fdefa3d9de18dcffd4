Mdani’s application was based on the grounds that the State had not made out a prima facie case against him, and therefore he had no case to answer. However, Judge Derek Wille ruled the State had in fact made out a case against him. The refusal to acquit was welcomed by the LGBTIQ community, with the Triangle Project praising the decision. Earlier, Mdani’s legal representative, Sheriff Mohammed, argued in court that “there is no evidence the accused committed the offences”. Mohammed said the State witnesses had no credibility, but Judge Wille said “issues of credibility play a minor role in discharging an accused”. The trial in the Western Cape High Court has been postponed until Monday, when Mdani is expected to take the stand.
