The City is a “port” sponsor of the Volvo Ocean Race which is due in Cape Town every year around this time. It's a well-known international event and part of the City’s rationale is that it will bring jobs and tourism. They therefore are one of the sponsors of the stopover at the V&A Waterfront – the Waterfront being part of a company run in the interest of its shareholders. It is not government owned, albeit it is part of a harbour; it's a private harbour of sorts. The Volvo Ocean Race prides itself on how professional they are, and no one can argue that. The truth is that they bring all their staff with them, from the people who do boat repairs to the person who will assist you at one of their stands. There is little if any employment offered. In fact, technically all their staff are likely to be working in South Africa without the correct visa, as they would likely be entering with a tourist visa. I wonder if Home Affairs would care to do an onsite check? Bottom line: the local populace do not benefit. The Volvo Ocean Race ships in almost everything required and therefore little local procurement takes place. Yes, there are hotel rooms used, flights in and out and restaurants benefit, but this is the beginning of the tourism season, so things are getting busy anyway. Can local government justify supporting this event, given that there is an internationally recognised yacht club (the Royal Cape Yacht Club) that brought all these events to Cape Town originally, and that seems to have been sidelined, as these events have been commercialised? Surely government should be working with them as the true stakeholder in yachting in Cape Town? This is a challenge to the editor to follow up when the race is here, to see if all foreigners have all the correct visas, and if so, on what grounds – that is, why could local skill not be used? And why does government ally with a commercial venture (the Waterfront)? Dale Kushner
