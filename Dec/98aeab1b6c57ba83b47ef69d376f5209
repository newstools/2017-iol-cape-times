Provincial authorities have said the Western Cape is preparing for potentially catastrophic wildfires this summer with hot, dry and windy conditions expected, exacerbated by the drought. Working on Fire (WOF) spokesperson Lauren Howard said more than 300 WOF fighters as well as fire-fighting aircraft had been actively assisting partners the Southern Cape Fire Protection Association, CapeNature, Provincial Disaster Management Centre, Greater Overberg FPA, Eden District Municipality, the City of Cape Town Fire and Rescue, and the Greater Cederberg FPA, in suppressing 19 fires in the province.  Affected areas include Grabouw, Botrivier, Caledon, Ladismith, Struisbaai, Bainskloof, Contreberg, Bergrivier, Skoenmakersfontein, Rietvlei and Macassar Dunes. “We urge communities to be more vigilant during this fires season and not to start unnecessary fires, particularly during dry days this summer.  "People must also ensure that they have the contact details of their local fire authorities at hand should there be a fire emergency,” Howard said.  According to Local Government and Environmental Affairs MEC Anton Bredell, about 9 000 wildfires were reported in the province between April1 last year and March 31 this year. “We implore the public to report fires speedily. Please do not throw out cigarette butts or make open fires outside when the wind is blowing.” The emergency toll-free number to report a fire is 112.
