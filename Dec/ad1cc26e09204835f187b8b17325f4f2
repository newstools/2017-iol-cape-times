CAPE TOWN - ER24 urge pet owners to ensure their dogs are well socialised and trained, after stating that the emergency service had responded to 103 dog attacks for this year alone.  In statement, ER24 stated that although dog attacks can happen anywhere and to anyone, children were still more vulnerable to these incidents.  Recent cases included that of a 6-month-old baby boy, killed after being  bitten multiple times by a dog in Primrose, Johannesburg and another of a woman being attacked by three dogs in Moreleta Park.  Animal Behavior Consultants of SA chairperson Shannon McKay said:  “A child’s smaller size and their more active body movements could simultaneously cause a dog to feel less concern for potential retaliation and their prey drive toward smaller animals could be triggered by a child’s erratic movements.  
Most children are also less skilled at interpreting canine body language and are thus less likely to defuse or avoid an aggressive encounter. For these reasons, parents should not allow unsupervised interaction between dogs and children.” She said there were a multitude of possible reasons for dogs attacking people including poor genetics, inappropriate environment, etc. 
If all dogs were to be ethically bred, appropriately socialised and managed according to their individual nature the instances of maulings would decrease substantially said McKay. ER24’s chief medical officer  Robyn Holgate said: “Clinically, we would triage the severity of the injury. The key to preventing infection and promoting wound healing is wound cleaning and disinfection. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for all bite wounds.” 
ER24 urge dog owners to teach children how to act and treat their pets, and to avoid any unfamiliar dogs or report any strays to the authorities.   Facebook    Twitter
