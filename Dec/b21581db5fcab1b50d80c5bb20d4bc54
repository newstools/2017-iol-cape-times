The 36-year-old man, who requested his name be withheld, had been cycling to Durbanville, where he was to meet with fellow cyclists when the three assailants pushed him off his bike and assaulted him with a pipe on Tuesday morning.  They robbed him of his cellphone and mountain bike in Amadeus Street, Zonnendal Kraaifontein, according to police. In an interview with the Cape Times on Wednesday, the cyclist lauded a resident walking her dogs, who freed him and called for help. “My body is still sore from the fall. They hit me with a pipe. I was on my way to meet buddies to go cycling. As I went around the corner there, three guys came from the side and pushed me off the bike. I fell.  "They then robbed me took everything I had. I did not put up a fight. One guy with a panga told the two other guys to take me to the bush,” he said. It was at this point he started panicking as he had complied with what they demanded. “I asked them why they wanted to take me to the bush when I had given them what they wanted. I questioned them again and they hit me with a pipe.  “They hit me on the back, arm and took me to the bush. They had a makeshift fire there, so obviously they were waiting for somebody to rob,” he said. “They had (another) argument and the leader with a panga told the guys to take me further into the bush and tie me to a tree.  “At that point I was quite scared and they left,” he said. He shouted for help after they left. “Luckily for me there was a lady from Buh Rein Estate who had taken her dogs for a walk and she heard me screaming.  "I have been told she contacted the security, the neighbourhood watch and police, and they came to rescue me,” he said.
