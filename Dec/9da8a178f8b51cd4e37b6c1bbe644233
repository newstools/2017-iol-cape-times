On Monday afternoon Mbulelo Mngqenge was on his way to Cape Town when he saw the two children, aged four and 14, “wandering aimlessly”.  Police spokesperson Andre Traut said Mngqenge picked up the children when he realised they were in danger.  “Compassion is not what many taxi drivers are known for, but it was quick thinking by Mngqenge who was on his way to Cape Town and observed two children wandering aimlessly along the N2 freeway.  "Realising the imminent danger they were facing, he stopped and took them to Mowbray police station,” Traut said.  When the two were dropped at the police station, Mowbray police then contacted Nyanga police station. Nyanga police then made contact with local social workers to trace the family of the children.  “In a province where the safety of children remains a sore point, one can only commend Mngqenge for diverting from his daily taxi routine to see the children were in safe hands.  "Police have since reunited the four-year-old boy with his family; meanwhile the 14-year-old girl has been taken to Groote Schuur Hospital for observation,” Traut said.  Station commander at the Mowbray police station, May-Louise Dyers, said they were pleased with the “happy ending” to this story.  “The two children, who we later established are cousins, were brought to our station at about 3pm. At the time I was busy in the charge office when Mngqenge brought them in.  "He said he brought them here because he trusted our police station and he knew we could help,” Dyers said.  She said they spoke to the children who gave them information on where they lived.  “This is a such a great turnout of events especially during the festive period. We are relieved the children are reunited with their families again in Langa and Nyanga,” she said.  Attempts to get hold of Mngqenge by deadline were unsuccessful.
