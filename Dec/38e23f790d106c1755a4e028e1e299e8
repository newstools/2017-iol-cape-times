A man and a woman suffered burns and were recovering in hospital. About 270 people were displaced after Sunday’s fire. An investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the fire. Acting mayor Rean Smuts said the Drakenstein municipality provided temporary shelter in the Thusong Centre in Paarl East to the affected families. Once the affected area has been cleared of all rubble, the municipality will assist with building material. “We sincerely regret this loss of life and extend our heartfelt sympathy to the families involved,” said Smuts. He said electricity had been restored to some sections in the affected area. However, electricity could not be restored to the Grysbok Flats and Spooky Square, which have been hit the hardest by the fire. “These areas are still regarded as electrically unsafe and have been isolated from our other electricity networks,” said Smuts. “Disaster relief efforts are under way at the Thusong Centre. The Red Cross is providing the homeless with brunch and supper, while Drakenstein municipality is ensuring that healthcare and medical services are provided.
