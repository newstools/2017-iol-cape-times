Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) has welcomed the election of Cyril Ramaphosa as the new president of the African National Congress (ANC), saying that he was more likely than any other candidate to tackle state capture, corruption and maladministration in government. "Of all the contenders for the ANC leadership, it was Ramaphosa who appears most willing to acknowledge and tackle the corruption scourge that has cost our nation dearly over the past decade under Jacob Zuma's rule," Outa's chief executive, Wayne Duvenage, said. Ramaphosa won with 2 440 votes to Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma's 2 261 votes to succeed Zuma in a hotly contested election held at the party's 54th national conference in Nasrec, Johannesburg.

Ramaphosa would lead the party while Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza was elected as his deputy, Gwede Manatshe as national chairperson, Free State Premier Ace Magashule as secretary-general, Paul Mashatile as treasurer-general, and Jessie Duarte retaining her deputy secretary-general position.
