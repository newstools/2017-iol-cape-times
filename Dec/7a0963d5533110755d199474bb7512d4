CAPE TOWN - The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) assured its beneficiaries on Monday that despite false information doing the rounds in public, the payment of social grants would continue as per normal and that their offices will be open for business during December. The announcement comes after information started circulating that beneficiaries will not receive their January payments due to Sassa offices being closed during the month of December. However, Sassa, in a statement, said their offices will only be closed on public holidays such as Christmas, New Year and Boxing Day. Sassa spokesperson Kgomoco Diseko said: “We urge our beneficiaries to report such acts of criminality to the police so that these scammers can be put behind bars.” Payments for December are currently being made and this will continue until 15 December at all Sassa pay points. According to Sassa, those that are using shops and ATMs to draw their grants are able to do so until December 22nd and this prevents beneficiaries from being caught up in the usual festive season rush. “From January 2018, social grant payments will be paid as usual from the first day of every month. Beneficiaries are urged to contact their local SASSA offices for any enquiries relating to their grant payments or call 0800601011,” Diseko said. Acting CEO of Sassa Pearl Bhengu said: “All social grant recipients should remain vigilant at this time of the year and never disclose their card details to anyone, including their PIN and ID numbers. I also want to take this opportunity to wish all beneficiaries of social grants a safe and happy festive season.” – African News Agency (ANA)
