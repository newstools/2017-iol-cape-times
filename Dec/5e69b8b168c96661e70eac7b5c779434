The occupants allege that the Cappello and All Nations nightclubs are flouting the law by staying open beyond the permissible time. But All Nations Nightclub manager Lambert Maleka said it had taken several measures to soundproof the establishment and denied that it stayed open until late. The complainant, who did not want to be named but has been living in the flats for more than two years, said the noise from the nightclubs was significant, especially over weekends, when it continued until 4am. She said she had called the police seven times but they were not helpful. Mayco member for Safety and Security JP Smith said his department dealt with the issuing of fines. “Where there are continued transgressions, the City’s law enforcement department compiles a docket for the attention of the Western Cape Liquor Authority (WCLA),” he said. Cappello had received a R20000 fine from the WCLA  for not complying with liquor trading hours. “The authority hasn't yet finalised its investigation into All Nations,” said Smith. Cappello’s Long Street manager, who refused to be named, said the bar closed at 2am and the music was immediately turned down.   Facebook    Twitter
