De Lille went to two houses in Pinelands and another in Thornton, telling the owners  it was necessary to install the devices because the province's dam levels were extremely low. De Lille said the water management devices would ensure that residents stick to the daily limit of 350 litres. Two of the owners were running a business in their homes, a hair salon and a laundry, and allowed the devices to be installed. Where consumption above 350 litres per day is justified, property owners can, however, make representation to the City to request a quota extension. De Lille said water usage of these households, over the past six months, ranged between
19 000 and 48 000 litres a month. The City’s teams had visited these properties twice already, but the owners became aggressive and law enforcement staff had to accompany officials to install the water meters, said De Lille. “The residents at these three properties also have no outstanding queries on their water accounts and have not requested a quota increase from the City.” This means that, on average, the daily consumption of these households often exceeded 
1 000 litres a day. De Lille said that although some Cape Town residents were helping in reducing water usage, “not everyone is doing their part”. Len Toucher, owner of one of the two properties in Pinelands, said “it’s fine and it’s all for a good cause” for the devices to be installed.
