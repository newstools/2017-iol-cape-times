The African National Congress in Gauteng on Saturday announced the nomination of Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to take over as president of the governing party at its national elective conference, where President Jacob Zuma is due to step down as leader of the former liberation movement. Ramaphosa led the pack of nominated candidates, with nominations from 374 Gauteng branches, easily oustripping his main rival, former African Union Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, who garnered nominations by 64 branches for the same position of ANC president.  The three-day ANC Gauteng provincial general council, currently under way in Pretoria, is a consolidation of policy positions and nominations for the province, before it joins the country's other eight provinces at the party's 54th national elective conference to be hosted in Johannesburg later this month.  So far, Ramaphosa is leading the pack regarding presidential nominations after being chosen by the ANC's provincial structures of the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Gauteng and the Northern Cape – while Dlamini Zuma is the preferred presidential nominee for Free State, North West and Mpumalanga.
