The woman, wearing a red shirt and denim skirt, can be seen on the CCTV footage passing a house with a baby wrapped in a blanket, then she passes the house again, this time empty handed.  Police are still conducting an investigation to locate the mother of the four-week-old baby.  The baby was taken to a place of safety in Heideveld after police referred the matter to Social Services.  Lansdowne Community Policing Forum chairperson Rafique Foflonker said although the footage “may not be clear, there is enough to put out there”.  “The woman can be seen wearing a distinct black and white handbag. One cannot see her face clearly in the footage because her face is obscured by the safety gates outside the home most of the time. “There are however one or two moments when she glances over her shoulder and you get a quick glimpse of her face. The woman is well-dressed and doesn’t look lousy at all, and the act of dumping the baby comes across as very deliberate. However, the motive is still unclear,” Foflonker said.  He added that according to his “own assessment” of the footage, “police have to be further along in the investigation by now”. The baby was found abandoned last week and no arrests have yet been made.  A police source said last week  residents alerted police of the abandoned baby.  The baby, dressed in only a T-shirt and a nappy, was taken to the nearby police station where an ambulance was called.  “After the baby was cleaned up, he was taken to Red Cross Children’s Hospital where further medical attention was given.” Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said a case of child abandonment was opened for investigation.
