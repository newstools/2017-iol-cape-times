Women contesting the presidency of the ANC for the first time showed that patriarchy within the governing party has been defeated, said national executive committee member Nomvula Mokonyane. Patriarchy was "entrenched and deep in the movement", she told reporters on the sidelines of the party’s national conference taking place in Nasrec, Johannesburg. "We have broken the back of patriarchy within the ANC... that is one of the things I am celebrating even before (election) results are announced. There has never been a woman candidate before... we made it," she said. Out of seven presidential hopefuls, which included two women, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and party Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa emerged as the contenders for the ANC top job on Sunday. Mokonyane declined nomination as party treasurer after receiving 289 nominations from KwaZulu-Natal on the Dlamini Zuma slate.  She said she declined nomination after reflecting on problems in the governing party and the "need for unity". "My view was that let me also demonstrate commitment to unity within the ANC and decline nomination in public, you cannot have three people running for the same position. I think this will be a contribution others will never forget." The treasurer position is being contested by Gauteng ANC chairman Paul Mashatile and NEC member Maite Nkoana-Mashabane. Mokonyane is a staunch supporter of President Jacob Zuma and had rallied behind Dlamini Zuma's campaign. However, she was unable to convince Gauteng's West Rand to pick the former African Union chairwoman.  Dlamini Zuma’s staunch supporters in the region also include Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen and ANC Youth League (ANCYL) treasurer Reggie Nkabinde. They all failed to convince branches to pick Dlamini Zuma. Her province endorsed Ramaphosa in the run up to the conference. Mokonyane said the ANC should be the winner after the conference and that she would rally behind the new leader elected. African News Agency (ANA)
