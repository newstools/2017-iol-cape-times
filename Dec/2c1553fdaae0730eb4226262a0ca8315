This is the view of Lucy Jamieson, a senior researcher at UCT’s Children’s Institute, who was a panellist at a discussion on gender-based violence held at the Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women and Children yesterday. Jamieson said: “South Africa is one the few countries in the world with the severity of violence we see here. “Intergenerational trauma, where parents have themselves been victims of violence, neglect or abuse, reduces the chances of creating an environment that is conducive to recovery for both mother and child. “We can change it, but it requires extensive work. People need special therapy.” Panellist Dorothea Gertse, the head social worker and shelter manager at a Manenberg-based centre, said the 60 children housed with them were all traumatised. “We see the violent interaction among peers, how they want to hit and threaten each other. “And the child taking on the role of perpetrator, with their mothers swearing and saying if you don’t do this, this is what’s going to happen,” she said. “However, they are fortunate enough to be here for intervention, but there are many children in our communities who do not have access to intervention.” Gertse said up to 400 women came to the centre each month. Both panellists called for improved systems for early intervention, quicker responses to reports of abuse and more collaboration between the professionals and agencies involved in child protection.   nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
