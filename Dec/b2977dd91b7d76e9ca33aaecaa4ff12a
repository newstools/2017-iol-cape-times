Three people have been arrested for alleged human trafficking in the Milnerton area, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) said on Monday. Two women, aged 33 and 34, as well as a 41-year-old man, were arrested and have appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court.  Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said the trio was arrested on Thursday by the Hawks’ serious organised crime unit for alleged human trafficking-related charges. “Members acted on information about a possible human trafficking incident in Milnerton area, near Cape town, from a non-governmental organisation.  "A 26-year-old victim was allegedly lured to Cape Town, from Johannesburg, by a lady known to her with promises of employment. “On arrival, two males allegedly picked her up and she was subsequently kept against her will and allegedly turned into a sex worker,” said Ramovha. Rhamovha said she managed to escape after a while and the matter was reported to the Hawks which led to the arrests. The victim’s ID book and cellphone were reportedly confiscated by the suspects.   The trio appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Friday and the matter was postponed to December 15 to allow for further investigations. The three accused remain in custody. African News Agency/ANA
