Smaller tourism establishments in the City of Cape Town are set to benefit from the distribution of water-saving shower heads to assist them during the worst drought in living memory. Wesgro – Cape Town and the Western Cape's official tourism, trade and investment promotion agency – will on Wednesday kick off the distribution of 1 800 low-flow shower heads as part of its campaign to help smaller tourism establishments save water. Mayor Patricia de Lille said last week said that the City will reach the so-called reach Day Zero – the day where the city runs out of water – if stubborn residents continue to use water excessively as all Capetonians are urged to reduce their water usage to below 87 litres per person per day. The City's level 6 water restrictions will come into force on January 1 and will restrict residential households to 10 500 litres a month and compel non-residential customers to cut their water consumption by 45 percent. The City is now making treated wastewater available to businesses dependent on water so that they can reduce their use and reliance on drinking water.  Charity organisations such as the Gift of the Givers and private businesses have all come on board to assist the City with water provisions and the production of new boreholes to the main water line. Last month, Wesgro, the Western Cape government, CapeNature and Airbnb announced that it would distribute a total of 2 300 low-flow shower heads to B&Bs and guesthouses across the Cape.  This includes a 500 allocation by AirBnb to its hosts to assist them in saving water. It is expected that this initiative will help save 70 million litres of water a year. On Wednesday, Wesgro will be joined by officials from the Cape Winelands District Municipality as well as the Stellenbosch Municipality at its one distribution point in Franschhoek.
