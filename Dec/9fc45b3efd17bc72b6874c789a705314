This month alone, 84 people have lost their lives on the province’s roads, ranging from drivers, bikers and passengers to pedestrians. Twenty-four drivers, two bikers, 12 passengers and 46 pedestrians – lost their lives between December 1 to 17. For the same period last year, without giving numbers on bikers, pedestrians and passengers, Grant’s spokesperson, Siphesihle Dube, said there were 14 road deaths. Four people were killed, including a 10-year-old boy, and nine others injured yesterday when four vehicles collided on the N1 highway in the Cape Winelands between Worcester and Rawsonville.  ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said a woman was lying trapped inside a light motor vehicle, while a man, as well as a boy and girl were found lying outside the same vehicle.  He said in the second vehicle a man was found lying motionless and trapped while another man was found lying outside the vehicle.  Six other passengers were found walking around at the scene. These deaths came a day after three other people were killed in a taxi crash  on Robert Sobukwe Drive in Bellville when a taxi driver lost control of his vehicle and collided with a light-motor vehicle. However, Grant said last year between December 1 and January 31, 248 lives were lost on provincial 
roads. “While this number showed a decrease in overall fatalities over this period compared to the previous year, the figure remains too high,” said Grant. He said the consumption of alcohol even in small amounts while driving a vehicle or walking “increases the risk of being involved in a crash”. “Not only does alcohol impair processes critical to safe road use, such as vision and reaction time, it 
is also associated with poor judgment 
and so is often linked to other 
high-risk road use behaviours such as speeding or not using seat-belts,” he added.
