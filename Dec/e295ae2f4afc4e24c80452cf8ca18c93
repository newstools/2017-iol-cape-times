This again angered residents who demanded he meet with them to address why payments did not commence and why options through other investors were rejected. The scheme, 4th Power Investment, had stopped paying investors in September last year after the Hawks raided their offices as Cupido had accepted cash deposits while not being licensed with the Financial Services Board (FSB). Cupido had informed investors that his accounts had been frozen by the investigative unit resulting in protests in November, where 800 people blocked roads. The investors had received a letter from the Hawks provincial office, stating no such action existed and that through correspondence with FSB he could proceed without being licensed.
