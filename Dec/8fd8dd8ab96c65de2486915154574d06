For nearly 100 years, the Cape Times Fresh Air Camp in Simon's Town has been making school holidays memorable for underprivileged children at its Froggy Pond base. There are eight camps a year - four for boys and four for girls. During the course of a week they get to take trips to the penguin colony, play lots of games, eat hearty meals and learn new songs to sing. They also learn valuable life-skills. This week 89 boys, aged six to eight, were at the camp, and next week it will be the girls’ turn. The chairperson of the Cape Times Fresh Air Fund, Les Williams, said they work with various schools and provincial social workers to identify children who would benefit from the camp. “The camp brings happiness for everyone,” Williams said. The Cape Times editor, Aneez Salie, said a little bit of kindness can make a world of difference, especially to a child. “Thanks to the generosity of our readers, who have been donating to the Cape Times Fresh Air fund for almost 100 years now. We are grateful to be able to make a difference,” Salie said. Yesterday, firefighters surprised the children and showed them how to protect and save themselves in a dangerous situation. The children now also know to dial 107 in the event of an emergency.
