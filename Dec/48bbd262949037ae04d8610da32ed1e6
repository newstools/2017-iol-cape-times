“We will never give up until we find out what happened to her,” said her sister Genevieve Boltman. The Mitchells Plain mother had left her home to go to work on the morning of April 20, 2016, but she never made it onto the bus and has not been seen since. Her daughter now two, was only three months old at the time. Her family had been searching, following every lead, even offering a reward of R10000, but all leads had been fruitless. “We really don’t know what to think, it is the same as day one, we are confused about what really happened,” said Genevieve. “This will be our second Christmas without her. It is very emotional for us on a daily basis.” She said the hardest part was “not knowing what happened to Raymonde”. The family have also since said they would prefer anyone with any information contacting the investigating officer directly. Any information related to the matter can be forwarded to Sergeant Ryneveldt at Lentegeur SAPS at 021 370  5837/083 648 6239 / PLTT: 072 214 7439.  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
