The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) has appealed for information on the owner of an unmanned sea kayak found offshore of Sea Point. The kayak was found floating offshore of Sea Point and unmanned on Sunday after being spotted by an NSRI coast watcher, NSRI Table Bay station commander Quentin Botha said. NSRI Table Bay searched the sea around Table Bay after the sea rescue craft Spirit of Day located and recovered the craft from the water one nautical mile offshore of the Sea Point Promenade, he said. Later, after finding no trace of anyone who may have been on the craft, the sea rescue craft Spirit of Vodacom was launched to join in the search and the NSRI rescue vehicle investigated slipways and launching sites up to Table View. The SAPS and sea rescue authorities confirmed they had had no reports of anyone missing or overdue, and the search was suspended at 4.30pm pending any new information, Botha said. "Only the craft has been recovered and NSRI are appealing to the owner, or anyone with information that may assist in identifying the owner of the craft, to call NSRI at 082 380 3800." The NSRI also appealed to owners of paddle craft, sail boards and surfboards to stencil their name and contact number, and the name and contact number of a responsible friend or family member on their craft for cases such as this.
