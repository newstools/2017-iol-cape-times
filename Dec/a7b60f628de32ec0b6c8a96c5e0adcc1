Is there anyone in Cape Town City Council actually doing traffic planning and traffic management? Who in their right mind would plan roadworks in December on the busiest tourist roads – Sea Point, Hout Bay, Fish Hoek? Why now, in December – creating back-up traffic that extends forever. Yet we never see a traffic controller/ pointsman actually managing this inevitable traffic build-up? Same goes for Kloof Road on the way to the cable car. On a hot summer afternoon it can take over an hour to get from the Waterfront to Camps Bay! While I’m at it, why do beach public toilets – that are in any event disgusting and minimally serviced – have to be closed by 6.30pm? This while tens of thousands of holidaymakers remain on the beaches – sometimes till after 9pm. It’s time Cape Town became more aware and more accommodating to the millions of tourists who help keep the city going. A contributing tourist. Alistair Brown Johannesburg
