Johannesburg - The ANC top leadership is expected to meet with disgruntled members on Friday to try and find a solution to the 68 "special votes" that were not counted at the party's elective conference.  
The members believe that the omission of their votes from the overall vote count could affect the final tally for the position of secretary-general that was won by Free State Premier Ace Magashule. 
 
The vote difference between Magashule and his counterpart, former KwaZulu-Natal Premier Senzo Mchunu, was 24 votes.  Read: #ANC54: Curiosity mounts over 68 missing votes          #ANC54: Mahumapelo says they'll call for re-vote if recount goes ahead  
The disgruntled members, from Limpopo and KZN, are supporters of Senzo Mchunu and they have demanded that their votes which are known as "special votes" should be included and have threatened to go to court. 
 
Lawyers representing the group delivered a letter of demand to the ANC at the conference on Wednesday. 
 
This was while a steering committee, put in place to look into the matter, was meeting to find a political solution to the impasse.  
On Wednesday night Magashule announced, before reading out the party's conference declaration, that of the 68 votes 14 were found lawful and were included in the vote count.
 
He insinuated that the issue was resolved. 
 
But lawyer Dexter Selepe, who represents the unhappy group, said the matter was far from over. The meeting with ANC leadership will start at 2pm this afternoon. 
 
The party’s leadership will try and find a solution that will avoid the matter from getting to court. Politics Hub
