Johannesburg - South Africa’s media is being used to stoke the African National Congress’s infighting, outgoing party leader President Jacob Zuma told delegates on Saturday. “”We should also be mindful of the fact that the media is an active participant, with vested interests rather than an impartial and fair observer on ANC organisational matters,” Zuma said during his address on the opening day of the party's 54th national conference taking place in Nasrec, Johannesburg. "The mobilisation of the media against the country and the ANC from Johannesburg to London, New York and Washington DC has gained momentum in recent months.” The party needed to reflect on how to communicate in a climate where “forces hostile to the ANC control the means and platforms of communication”, he added. Zuma said the use of the media was due to internal divisions and the pursuit of personal interests, with some ANC members actively using the media to fight personal battles against the ANC, “despite the fact that this damages the standing of the movement and the country internationally”.
