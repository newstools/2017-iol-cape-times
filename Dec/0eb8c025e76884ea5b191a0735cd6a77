Cape Town - The director of a Cape Town company gave his staff R100 000 to spread goodwill among the city's residents, and on Thursday they set out to just that. The company, which wants to remain anonymous, sent their Secret Santa to shopping centres in Cape Town's northern suburbs. Their first stop was Shoprite in Voortrekker Road, Bellville, where their Santa randomly selected shoppers then surprised them by paying for their purchases once they got to the till - no strings attached. They did the same for some elderly women who were shopping at the OK Bazaars supermarket near Huize Andre Van Der Walt, a local old age home. From there, the team moved on to Parow Centre and repeated their amazing act of kindness at Checkers and PEP Stores before taking their generous Christmas spirit to Pick n Pay in Edgemead.  At each stop, the group was overwhelmed by the emotional response to their kindness. One lucky shopper cried when she learned that her purchases were being paid for by the group, who say they just want people to know that amid all the challenges we face daily there are still people willing to lend a helping hand. On Friday, the company extended their Secret Santa generosity to Communicare-linked VulaMathuba in Bishop Lavis where they collected a list of benificiaries for a gift haul. "We would like people to know there are still people out there that care and that humanity is still alive and kicking," said a staff member.  IOL
