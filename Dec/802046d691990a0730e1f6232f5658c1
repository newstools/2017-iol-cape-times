Zimbabwe's new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has vowed
to ensure free and fair elections, as well as make the country's
troubled economy attractive to investors, in his first state of the
nation address. The leader known as "the Crocodile" replaced long-time president
Robert Mugabe in the wake of a November military coup. "My government is committed to entrenching a democratic society
driven by the respect for the constitution, the rule of law, mutual
tolerance, peace and unity," Mnangagwa told parliament on Wednesday. Zimbabweans were euphoric after Mugabe was ousted, but many quickly
became doubtful he would provide any meaningful change after he
appointed a cabinet full of Mugabe era politicians.  Last week Mnangagwa's special adviser and war veteran leader, Christopher Mutsvangwa, told the media that the ruling Zanu-PF party
would work with the military to ensure victory in the 2018 elections. Mnangagwa aimed to reassure voters, saying the "government will do all in
its power to ensure that the 2018 general elections, are credible,
free and fair". He is expected to appoint former head of the army Constantino
Chiwenga as his vice-president after he retired him this week
"pending redeployment".Â  Chiwenga took on near-hero status after he
was instrumental in organising the coup. Mnangagwa also said he would fix Zimbabwe's suffering economy, which
deteriorated severely under Mugabe's rule. Inflation at one point in
2008 hit 231 million percent.  "My government is committed to open Zimbabwe up to investment," the
75-year-old leader said in his 30-minute address. With high levels of unemployment and poverty many Zimbabweans have
crossed the border to seek work in neighbouring South Africa.
