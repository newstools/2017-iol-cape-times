The man was arrested after an incident on Sunday  where a 23-year-old man was beaten to death in Grassy Park. A police source confirms the man was assaulted, allegedly 
by neighbourhood watch members, but this could not be confirmed. “It is believed the man was assaulted in Grassy Park and taken to Philippi and from there he was taken to hospital.  "When he arrived at (the) hospital he was certified dead on arrival,” the source said. Police spokesperson Andrè Traut said a murder investigation is being conducted by Grassy Park police detectives. “The suspect, 28, was arrested yesterday and he will appear on a charge of murder in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court once charged.” The police source further said if it were true that the suspect was part of a neighbourhood watch, this was unacceptable. In an unrelated incident, on Tuesday, a 24-year-old man was arrested in Hanover Park for the possession of a firearm and ammunition. Traut said: “The circumstances surrounding the matter are still being investigated and the suspect is due to make a court appearance in Athlone once he has been charged.” The police source said police were busy with patrols in the area when they noticed two suspicious-looking men. “The suspects saw the police vehicle and started running.  "The one suspect got away, but police pursued the second suspect and when they apprehended him, they found him in possession of the firearm and ammunition. “The community actually aided quite a big deal in the arrest and guided police to where the suspect was running to. This also shows (the) community wanting to assist police.” If you have any information relating to crime incidents, report to Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
