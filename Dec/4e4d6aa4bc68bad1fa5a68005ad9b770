Cape Town - The family of a 21-year-old woman who went missing earlier this week said they are distraught and “just want her home again”.  Qamrunisah Moerat from Woodstock was last seen at her Woodstock family home on Monday morning.  Her father, Mogamat Moerat, said they “miss her terribly” and want her to return home safely.  “She was last seen at home on Monday when she left at about 7am. We haven’t heard from her since and just want her to return safely,” he said.  Moerat said his daughter, who was set to return to her law studies at the University of Western Cape next year and the eldest of two daughters, never ran away from home before.  “This is the first time that something like this happened. She doesn’t come from a broken or unstable home. Everything is in order, that is why we cannot understand what happened,” Moerat said.  He said attempts to get hold of his daughter via telephone proved fruitless each time.  “Whenever we call her phone it either rings and if you call back later it is completely switched off,” he said.  The concerned father said leads were received saying that she was last seen with a man not known to the family.  “We heard she was last seen with a man that is described as her friend. However, we do not know this man from a bar of soap,” he said.  Police spokesperson Andre Traut said the woman was reported missing at the Woodstock police station and her disappearance is under investigation.  According to the Pink Ladies Missing Persons Organisation Qamrunisah was last seen wearing a pink top with white pants. - chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
