“The festival was a key event for identifying new cricketing talent in Cape Town. Cricket coaches from the NGO Sporting Chance, helped the enthusiastic youngsters to hone their skills and a team from the Gary Kirsten Cricket Academy identified youngsters with promise who could benefit from cricket coaching and opportunities throughout the year,” said chairperson of the Rotary Club of Claremont’s Outreach Programme, Monique Stuart-Fox. The programme has managed to produce players such as Protea cricketer Temba Bavuma, who attended the festival in the late 1990s, Malusi Siboto, who now plays for the Titans, and Nono Pongolo, who plays for the Lions, as well as former Protea wicketkeeper Thami Tsolekile. Funding support from the Rotary Club of Claremont covered the cost of transporting the children to the beach for the day and ensured they were well nourished with snacks, refreshments and lunch. Participants received a T-shirt and a goodie bag of treats. “This cricketing event inspires a passion in the sport and offers an alternative activity for children from underprivileged communities, who are at high risk of being exposed to drugs, alcohol and gangsterism. Bavuma, Tsolekile, Siboto and Pongolo are proof enough that the Calypso Cricket Festival is a fantastic event that offers a bright future to those with sporting potential,” said Stuart-Fox. Cape Argus
