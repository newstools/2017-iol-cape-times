A 33-year-old man appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Monday for allegedly defrauding a bank client of over R1.2 million, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (better known as the Hawks) said. Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said the man allegedly manipulated the bank system and created new internet banking profiles for an account belonging to an FNB client held at a local branch in Hout Bay. "He allegedly further authorised bank cards on the said account and enabled fraudulent transfers into various bank accounts, resulting in the client losing the above mentioned amount. "An internal forensic probe by the bank was initiated after the client lodged a complaint," Ramovha said. He said the Hawks were roped in to investigate and the 33-year-old man was arrested while he was on duty. "The accused has been granted bail of R5 000 with strict conditions and is expected back in court on February 9, 2018 to face charges of alleged fraud, money laundering and contraventions of Electronic Communications and Transactions Act. "Additional arrests cannot be ruled out as investigations continue." African News Agency
