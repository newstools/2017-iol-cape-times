The High Court in Pretoria on Wednesday ruled that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng will select the judge to preside over the state capture commission of inquiry ordered by former public protector Thuli Madonsela. "The president [Jacob Zuma] is directed to appoint a commission of inquiry within 30 days, headed by a judge solely selected by the Chief Justice [Mogoeng]," said Judge President Dunstan Mlambo when he delivered the judgment on behalf of a full bench. "The president shall take steps which are necessary to give effect to the remedial action [prescribed by Madonsela] and ensure that the judge who heads the commission of inquiry is given powers to appoint his/her own staff, and to investigate all the issues using the record of the public protector's investigation and the State Capture report." The court dismissed Zuma's application to review former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's State Capture report. In his judgment, Mlambo said the stance adopted by Zuma in 2016 on the status of the report was "completely unreasonable". Judge Mlambo said there was no basis for Zuma's application to interdict the release of the report. "The president's persistence to continue with the application [for an interdict against the public protector] amounts to abuse of the judicial process," said Mlambo. "He is ordered to personally pay the costs." African News Agency/ANA
