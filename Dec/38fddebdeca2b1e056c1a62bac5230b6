The race to succeed President Jacob Zuma as ANC leader is being closely watched by traders as it will determine the future policy trajectory for the country’s economy, which is grappling with credit rating downgrades and weak growth. Ramaphosa is seen as more business-friendly than his main rival in the leadership contest, former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, who was previously married to Zuma. At 5pm, the rand bid at R13.6111 to the dollar, 8.85c firmer than at the same time on Friday.  Ramaphosa yesterday won the most nominations for party leader in Limpopo. “The good news coming through that Cyril Ramaphosa is getting a lot more support is possibly giving the rand a bit of an injection.  "Obviously markets view it as positive, but it is still a long way (to the conference),” said TreasuryOne currency dealer Phillip Pearce. Ramaphosa has more nominations for party leader than Dlamini-Zuma after all nine provinces revealed their nominations. After the largest province, KwaZulu-Natal, voted in favour of Dlamini Zuma, she has the support of four provinces and Ramaphosa five.
