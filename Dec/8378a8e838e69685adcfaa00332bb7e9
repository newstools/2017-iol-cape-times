The Democratic Alliance on Monday filed criminal charges against reinstated acting Eskom CEO Matshela Koko for alleged breach of the Public Finance Management Act, the party's public enterprises spokeswoman Natasha Mazzone said. "Following the sham of a disciplinary hearing, clearing Koko of all charges relating to misconduct, we have laid charges in terms of the Public Finance Management Finance Act (PFMA) as we believe Koko may have used his position at Eskom to improperly benefit his stepdaughter's company and her, which, if true, is a violation of the PFMA," Mazzone said. Koko is alleged to have been involved in awarding Eskom contracts worth R1 billion to Impulse International, a company linked to his stepdaughter. "Since Eskom and the Minister of Public Enterprises, Lynne Brown, are incapable of holding the seemingly captured and heavily implicated Koko to account, it is up to the Hawks to investigate the matter and to take action should the investigation find evidence of wrongdoing," Mazzone said. A disciplinary hearing last week found Koko not guilty of all charges and the chairman of the hearing ordered his reinstatement. He faced six chargesâ€š including that of allegedly failing to declare a conflict of interest around his stepdaughter's business interests. African News Agency/ANA
