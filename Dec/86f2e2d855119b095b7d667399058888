Cape Town - Five men pursued by police caused two accidents which killed three people in Khayelitsha. 
Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: “Harare police were on their way to Eerste River, when they were at the corners of Spine Road and Forest Drive. They spotted a white Toyota bakkie that drove recklessly in front of them down Forest Drive into Spine Road in the direction of Khayelitsha.” The three surviving suspects in the bakkie, aged between 18 and 21, have been charged with reckless and negligent driving and culpable homicide. One of the suspects cracked his skull and broke most of the bones in his body. When Weekend Argus visited the scene, forensic pathologists were sifting through the wreckage. According to Rwexana, the driver of the bakkie lost control in Spine Road and collided with a white Chevrolet. According to witnesses, the vehicle had been chasing the suspects and “attempted to block the road but the bakkie drove into the car pushing it off the road and the bakkie overturned”. Rwexana could not confirm if one of the dead, a 41-year-old man, was a police officer. “All together, three people died during the two accidents and circumstances are under investigation,” she added.
