Local businesses were bracing themselves for what is expected to be another eventful race, as thousands of people are expected to  flock into the township on the day. Gugulethu business owner Peter Motale said the event unified people from across the province. During an interview with the Cape Times, he said the race was growing bigger  every year. “The event helps many young and old to exercise. This is not Nelson Mandela preaching but, if we can follow in his footsteps of exercising every day we can be fit and live up to 96 or more years,” he said. He has encouraged other local businesses to make use of the event to grow their establishments. “By supporting it (event) financially, the race will grow even faster. By talking about the race in clubs, churches, schools and gyms it will expand even faster. "I wish everybody good luck and to spread the gospel in our churches and schools. This is, indeed, a run for unity,” Motale said. Runners will be representing clubs from all over the province; local celebrities will include TV personality Dr Michael Mol and the race MC for this year, Siv Ngesi. The race starts and ends at the NY49 Stadium in Gugulethu. It includes a 10km race and a 4.2km fun run. More than 1 500 participants are expected to take part in the race. Spot prizes, food stalls and loads of fun activities for the young ones are sure to make this a perfect family outing. The race was organised by  RCS in association with the Cape Times and Clicks.
