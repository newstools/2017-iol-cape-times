The teenager,  a pupil at John Ramsay Senior Secondary in Bishop Lavis, according to eyewitnesses, was shot three times. The 16-year-old was killed  after 4pm on Tuesday and another victim was injured during the same shooting, said police spokesperson FC van Wyk. “(Police) confirm a shooting incident on Tuesday at approximately 4.20pm in Rondeberg Road, Bishop Lavis where a 16-year-old boy was fatally wounded and a 17-year-old boy was injured,” Van Wyk said. Police say the 17-year-old was shot in his right leg and was taken to a nearby hospital for medical treatment. They would not confirm how many bullet wounds the murder victim suffered. Van Wyk said the motive for the shootings was unknown. “The suspects are also unknown. A murder and an attempted murder case docket was registered for investigation. No arrest has been made as yet,” he said. Bishop Lavis community policing forum chairperson Graham Lindhorst said the shooting was “believed to be a case of mistaken identity”. “Apparently the suspects who did the drive-by shooting, from a Polo and Audi, were looking for a man who actually lives in the next street. The victim was on crutches and the intended target is also on crutches. “They shot the teenager once in the head and twice elsewhere on the body. “There were 16 cartridges found on the scene,” Lindhorst said. According to Lindhorst the shooting was related to ongoing gang violence in the area over the past year. Anyone with information can call 073 413 8102 or Crime Stop on 086 00 1 0111.
