The City of Cape Town is in the process of upgrading the 111-year-old City Hall and surrounding area to increase its attraction as an events venue. The revamp started a few months ago and repainting of the main entrance hall, refurbishment of the slate roof, and repairs to the organ have already been completed. Further modifications will include replacing existing seating, restoration of the floor, repairing the stage and backstage area. The contractor will also be restoring all of the mouldings, painting the auditorium, installing mechanical ventilation and installation of a public address system. Mayoral committee member for assets and facilities management Stuart Diamond said they would reinstate a monthly free concert once the building was revamped. Upgrades will cost  R27 million.
