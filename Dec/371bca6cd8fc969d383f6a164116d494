The festival, in partnership with the City, is expected to draw crowds of between 60000 and 100000 people. Previously known as the Tweede Nuwe Jaar Minstrel Parade, The Cape Town Street Parade seeks to be an inclusive carnival for all the people who participate in it and who support it. Some of the roads that will be closed from 6am until midnight include Keizergracht Street, Sir Lowry Road, and Darling, Adderley, Plein, Tennant, Canterbury, Harrington and Parliament streets. Kaapse Klopse Karnival Association director Muneeb Gambeno said 60 minstrel troupes from all areas across Cape Town were expected to perform in the streets of the City Centre between Keizergracht Street in District Six and Rose Street in Bo-Kaap. The parades will open with a welcome at noon on a Bo-Kaap stage, where dignitaries will address the crowds. The event's live entertainment  includes artists such as Loukmaan Adams, Austin Rose, Monox Adams, The Woodstock Darlings, riel dancers the Tiervlei Vastrappers van Ravensmead, and Nova Caine. Gambeno said: “We are particularly excited to this year include the riel dancers, performing the ancient celebratory dance of the San, Nama and Khoi. We look forward to making this an integral part of the Cape Town Street Parade as we recognise and honour our cultural heritage. Gambeno added that the Voorsmaakie event held on December 16 had been “wonderful”. “This event is being returned to the people, and Saturday marked the start of what we expect will be the best Tweede Nuwe Jaar celebrations that Cape Town has seen in many years.  ‘‘This year there will be two stages, one on the Grand Parade and one in Wale Street, with exceptional entertainment throughout the day.”
