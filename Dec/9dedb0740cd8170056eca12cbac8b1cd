Theo Kruger, the director of TwoFiveFive, was accused of being elected “irregularly” as chairperson of the association at an annual general meeting on October 31. He was subsequently removed on November 28. Kruger’s backing off and not contesting his removal was welcomed by residents and OCA members. OCA executive committee member Leslie London said: “He (Kruger) did not have to go that mile. Instead he should have resolved the difference when he was alerted to the irregularities. It’s clear he had lots of options but chose to do what suits him.”  According to interim chairperson Tauriq Jenkins, Kruger was removed because of concerns that he was elected irregularly. Jenkins said some of the voters were not eligible to vote as they had no physical and business addresses in Observatory, but Kruger said TwoFiveFive has an office in Lower Main Road in Observatory, he has a property in the area and has been an active member for more than a year. To further avoid a potential conflict of interest, Kruger intentionally abstained from standing for a position in architecture and heritage at the OCA, which would have given him an advantage to comment or approve architectural documentation. Kruger told the Cape Times his election was neither unconstitutional, unethical or unlawful. “Unfortunately, and in spite of numerous attempts at fostering a spirit of co-operation, TwoFiveFive has experienced much resistance from the OCA in realising a more progressive and integrated suburb,” said Kruger. He said the resistance was by way of “unnecessarily lengthy procedural delays”. Kruger said his removal was “disappointing”.  He would continue to participate in the OCA with a view “towards achieving an integrated and progressive Observatory for all”. “I believe that I can add a great deal of value to the association in the future,” he said.
