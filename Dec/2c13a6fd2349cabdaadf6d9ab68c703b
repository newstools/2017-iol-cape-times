The City rolled out Operation Exodus on Friday, which saw traffic officials at roadblocks on the lookout for drunk drivers and unroadworthy vehicles. Traffic officials said yesterday a motorist was arrested for drunken driving after being almost six times above the legal limit. The driver was among 26 drivers taken into custody for driving under the influence.  Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (Cata) said it would join forces with the City and also initiated its own road safety programme. At the Joe Gqabi bus terminus in Philippi yesterday thousands of people queued to board buses and mini bus taxis.  Masibephi Telei, 37,with her three children spent five hours at the bus terminus waiting to board the next bus to the Eastern Cape.  Telei said he’d rather take a bus instead of minibus as bus drivers kept to speed limits. Cata spokesperson at Joe Gqabi Thembekile Silwana said all their taxis would adhere to having their vehicles checked before taking the road trip. Mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said any vehicle found not to be roadworthy would be  prohibited from travelling further. He said last year 1 034 public transport vehicles were checked before departure in the run-up to Christmas Eve.  Provincial traffic chief Kenny Africa said they recorded five road fatalities including one of a pedestrian on the N7 at Du Noon. He said the highest reading came from a Vredendal motorist with a reading of 1.37mg/1000ml, nearly six times over the legal limit.  Four drivers were arrested for being in possession of false documentation.
