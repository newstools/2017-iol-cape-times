Johannesburg - The third day of the 54th ANC national elective conference started off as a continuation of the previous night that saw delegates voting continue well into the early hours of the morning. While voting for the Top Six continues with the last province, Gauteng, the day programme will see current secretary general Gwede Mantashe give a media briefing on the Organisational Report followed by the Financial Report by treasurer general Zweli Mkhize. The announcements of the results from the voting will be followed by the nominations of additional national executive committee (NEC) members. The organisational report encapsulates the performance of the ANC over the last five years covering issues related to threats to the organisation, the challenges within the alliance, state capture, the issue of white monopoly capital and economic transformation. So far the third Progressive Business Forum breakfast has taken place. The keynote address was given by Minister of Small Business Development who spoke about how to enhance local small business especially township businesses and how to access procurement opportunities from government through its goods and services budget. The media briefing for the Organisational Report is yet to begin. The Star
