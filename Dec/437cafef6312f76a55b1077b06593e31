The ANC in the Eastern Cape said it condemned the murder, which was allegedly committed by three abakhwetha (initiates). “The arrest of abakhwetha from an initiation school in the Eastern Cape over allegations of murdering a 65-year-old woman is disturbing because the abakhwetha were in the process of being taught to protect their families, women and those vulnerable in society and not to murder them as has been alleged,” the ANC said in a statement attributed to the party’s provincial chairperson, Lubabalo Oscar Mabuyane. “The ANC in the Eastern Cape sends its deepest condolences to the family of the woman who was allegedly killed by these initiates. "We call on the law enforcement agencies to investigate this matter thoroughly and with efficiency so that we can ascertain who killed this woman, who was a mother and a relative to her people. “The community will not rest until details of this case are ascertained. "As the ANC, we encourage the police and the NPA (National Prosecuting Authority) to work together to get to the bottom of this crime.” The suspects were expected to appear in court soon.
