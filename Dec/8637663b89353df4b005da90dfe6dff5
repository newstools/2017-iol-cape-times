The city has urged the public to comment on the draft Water Amendment By-law which the city hopes will further enhance
Cape Town’s ability to become a more water-sensitive and resilient city
in the future. The public has until January 8, 2018 to comment.  In 2015, the by-law was amended to ensure the city could adequately monitor and control all water-related services and oversee the plumbing industry. However, due to the impact of the worst drought in recorded history, the city says the by-law requires further amendments.  City Mayco member for informal settlements, water and waste services; and energy, Xanthea Limberg said: “The amendments attempt to address the city’s emphasis on proactive governance to better adapt to the New Normal, which recognises our position in a water-scarce region.” Khayelitsha Development Forum (KDF) chairperson Ndithini Tyhido called for a thorough public participation process to educate and inform communities around Cape Town regarding matters of water, owing to the severity of the crisis.  “This type of situation needs to help the public to streamline and formulate their comments. "Because of this crisis, we only hope that the city will give itself time to take the community with them and walk through their plans so communities can work with the city,” he said.  The public can view the proposed by-law at subcouncil offices and at http://www.capetown.gov.za/City-Connect/Have-your-say/Issues-open-for-public-comment/comment-on-the-proposed-draft-water-amendment-by-law Comments can be sent to WaterPollution.Control@capetown.gov.za
