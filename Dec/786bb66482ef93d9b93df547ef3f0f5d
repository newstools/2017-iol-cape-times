Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a woman and a man were shot in Prunus Street, but the victims survived the incident.  “Cases of attempted murder were opened for investigation following a shooting incident that occurred on Wednesday at 9.55pm in Prunus Street, Bonteheuwel.  "According to reports two victims, aged 19 and 22, were shot and wounded,” Rwexana said.  No one has been arrested at this stage, Rwexana said.  In another incident, police spokesperson Andrè Traut said three suspects had been arrested in Table View yesterday after being found in possession of a stolen vehicle.  “Eager to protect the community, members of Table View police were patrolling their area during the early hours of yesterday morning when their attention was drawn to a black Hyundai i10 with three male occupants.  “Members were aware that a similar vehicle was hijacked in Muizenberg on December 17 and decided to pull the vehicle over to investigate the matter,” Traut said.  Police conducted an investigation and discovered it was the reported stolen vehicle.  “The three suspects, aged in their twenties, were arrested and are due to make a court appearance for the possession of a stolen vehicle in Cape Town once they have been charged.  "The circumstances surrounding their involvement in the hijacking and other crimes are also under investigation,” Traut said.  Also in the Milnerton area, another suspect was arrested with a “substantial quantity of dagga”, Traut said.  “Police members doing crime prevention duties during the early hours of this morning followed up on information they received about drug activities in Umtata Drive, Joe Slovo.  "The identified premises was searched, which led to the discovery of a large quantity of dagga with an estimated street value of R200 000,” Traut said.   A 46-year-old suspect was arrested and he will make a court appearance once he has been charged.
