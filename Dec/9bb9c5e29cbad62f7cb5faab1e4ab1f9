One of only two remaining Rivonia trialists, Denis Goldberg, 84, had harsh words for the state of the ruling party as he remembered his friend and revered founding president Nelson Mandela on the fourth anniversary of the icon’s death yesterday. Goldberg, Mandela, Govan Mbeki, Walter Sisulu and six other MK guerrillas were tried from June 1963 to October 1964 and each sentenced to life. Mandela died aged 95 at his Houghton home in Johannesburg after undergoing treatment for a lung infection.  “He (Mandela) would be appalled to have a government which violates the constitution. He would be appalled by the corruption and cronyism. It is not what he spent 27 years in prison for.  “In the forthcoming elections, we have to have ANC people in leadership positions who respect our constitution. If we go on as we are, we will get thrashed in the 2019 elections,” he said.  Goldberg fondly remembered how, with a 15-year age gap between them, Mandela had affectionately called him “boy” and he referred to the older man as “Nel”.  Goldberg said he had seen Mandela shortly before his death, and at the time had spoken about Madiba’s fighting spirit.  The Nelson Mandela Foundation yesterday launched an exhibition called Unthreading Mandela, part of a project ahead of the centenary celebrations of Mandela’s birth next year.
