The board and executives of South Africa's state-owned freight and logistics company, Transnet, will be summonsed to appear before Parliament's standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) after a no-show on Wednesday. Board  chairwoman Linda Mabaso and her team were expected to respond to MPs on questionable contracts worth billions of rand, but she indicated to Scopa chairman Themba Godi on Monday she would prefer the meeting take place in January.  Mabaso, according to Godi, called her again on Tuesday, saying she and her team would not be appearing. Godi informed her the meeting would go ahead and she and her team were expected to attend. When Mabaso and Transnet executives failed to pitch, MPs were left incensed.  They accepted a proposal from Godi that Mabaso and her team be summonsed to appear before the committee. "We need to call them the very second day of committee week in January, but instead of inviting them, we should rather summons them, subpoena them so they suffer the indignity of being supoenaed," Godi said.
