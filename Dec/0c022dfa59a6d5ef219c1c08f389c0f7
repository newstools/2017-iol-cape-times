Experts at the aquarium had been watching the weather closely as they waited for the summer months to warm the water about 27 nautical miles off Hout Bay, where Yoshi was released on Saturday morning.  Along with Yoshi, 27 rehabilitated hatchling loggerhead turtles were also released. Yoshi was fitted with a satellite tag as researchers hope to track her journey for up to three years. Given that female sea turtles always return to the beaches where they hatched, to lay their own eggs, Yoshi now has the opportunity to follow her natural instinct towards her home range either up the east coast or the west coast of Africa.  Weighing 183kg, Yoshi is within the sexual maturity range and exhibited certain new behaviours, leading to the curatorial team to decide it was time for her to be released.  Yoshi was the size of a dinner plate when she arrived at the Aquarium in 1996.  She was handed over by a chef on board a fishing vessel in Table Bay harbour. She was named after the chef, Yoshi.   It is estimated that she was between three and five years of age at the time.  She has since grown into a magnificent ambassador for her species and enthralled thousands of visitors to the Aquarium over the years.  Two Oceans Aquarium Curator Maryke Musson said: “Yoshi is an absolute legend, and has been part of our turtle conservation and rehabilitation story for many years. She arrived at the Aquarium broken and lost, and it is amazing to know that we contributed to giving her that one-in-a-thousand chance of reaching reproductive age. ”  Each year the Two Oceans Aquarium rehabilitates and releases sea turtles that have been found stranded on Western Cape beaches.  “I cannot wait to see where Yoshi goes. She is ready to cross oceans. We will follow her every move as long as we get satellite transmission, hopefully for a few years, and yes, the NSRI is on standby should she need any assistance,” said Musson.
