A resolution that schools will be compelled to teach at least one indigenous language has been adopted at the 54th African National Congress conference in Johannesburg on Wednesday. "Certainly on the language resolution it was adopted that all schools in South Africa should offer at least one of the indigenous languages of our country and that would mean three languages are in all our schools in South Africa," said Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor while briefing journalists on the outcomes of the Education, Health and Technology commission. The same stance was adopted during the previous elective conference in Mangaung in 2012 and was meant to be implemented in 2014. However, this had not yet happened.Â  At the time, schools said they lacked the resources and teachers to implement such a decision. African News Agency (ANA)
