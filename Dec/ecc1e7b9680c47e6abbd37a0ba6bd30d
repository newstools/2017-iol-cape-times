Golden Arrow said in a statement yesterday that the adjustment was as a result of soaring fuel costs. Pensioner fares and most off-peak fares will not increase. “Over the last 12 months, the diesel price has increased by 12%, while the nationally determined wages increased by 9%. These two cost items make up approximately 74% of Golden Arrow’s total costs.  "This is further compounded by the cumulative shortfall in funds from the Division of Revenue Act subsidy allocation, which has not been in line with the contracted escalation rate.  "Despite this, we have continued with our fleet recapitalisation and over the last 12 calendar months, 65 buses have been added to the fleet at a cost of approximately R140 million. This programme will continue in 2018,” they said. The last increase of 4.45% was on December 26 last year. The announcement comes as Metrorail continues to struggle to fix its central line, which was unusable owing to cable theft, vandalism and damage to infrastructure this week, leaving thousands of commuters scrambling to find alternative transport home. Metrorail said weekly and monthly ticket holders could use Golden Arrow Buses off-peak (up to 3.30pm and then again after 6.30pm). Metrorail is offering a reward of up to R25 000 for information leading to a conviction for cable theft. Full anonymity is guaranteed, and reports of any rail-related criminal activity can be lodged with the Metrorail Protection Service hotline on 021 449 4336/5056.
