CAPE TOWN - Three-year-old  boy Clinton Swartbooi will this week learn if his legs severely damaged in a fire can be saved or will have to be amputated. The toddler and his family live in a rural town called Gibeon, a village in Gibeon Constituency in the Hardap Region of Namibia.  In September the boy fell into a fire pit, severely burning his legs as he tried to climb out of the pit. He was rushed to hospital but his parents refused to allow the public health authorities to amputate his legs. The young boy now requires an Orthopaedic surgeon to examine his legs and  Dr Francois Pretorius said that due to the time that elapsed in the boy receiving help, the outcome in all likelihood would mean amputations. In a video by a local news agency, Pretorius said that he has spoken to a specialist in Windhoek who has suggested amputating the toes and a skin transplant for the infected areas.

However, the cost for Swartbooi’s medical stay could be between 50 000 to 100 000 Namibian dollars, which excludes the cost for his stay following any procedure.. Pretorius said however that due to the severity of the damage to the toddler’s legs and the time that has elapsed, that amputation might be the final outcome.
