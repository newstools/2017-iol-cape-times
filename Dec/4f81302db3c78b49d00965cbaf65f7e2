“With the new moon spring tide now upon us beach bathers and shoreline anglers are most at risk,” NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said. Anglers fishing along the shoreline, particularly along rocks on the shoreline, were at greatest risk during the spring tide, where incoming waves during the high tides encroached higher than normal over rocks. Anglers should not turn their back to the sea and should be vigilant and cautious of the wave action at all times while fishing. The next spring tide will be the full moon spring tide on January 2, Lambinon said. This as more than 2million people are expected to flock to beaches during the peak summer season. The City has increased the number of lifeguards on its beaches with more than 270 trained and accredited temporary lifeguards, and over 1 500 volunteer lifeguards on duty, including the voluntary services of the various lifesaving clubs affiliated to Lifesaving Western Province. The City urged people to stay safe this summer at its amenities, following two drownings recorded on Wednesday at Mnandi Beach on the False Bay coast - both victims were young girls. Mayoral committee member for safety and security; and social services, JP Smith said: “We still have far too many people who swim outside of the designated bathing areas and who disregard the instructions of lifeguards. ‘‘Alcohol is the other major factor that bedevils our efforts to ensure public safety. Lifeguards will be deployed between 10am and 6pm daily to 22 beaches until the end of January.” The following beaches will have lifeguards on duty: Big Bay, Bikini, Blue Waters, Camps Bay, Clifton, Danger, Fish Hoek, Gordon’s Bay, Hout Bay, Kalk Bay, Kogel Bay, Llandudno, Macassar Beach, Melkbosstrand, Milnerton, Mnandi, Monwabisi, Muizenberg, Silwerstroom, Strand, Strandfontein Beach and Sunrise. Alcohol is not permitted at any of Cape Town’s beaches or swimming pools and any alcohol found on beaches will be confiscated by law enforcement.
