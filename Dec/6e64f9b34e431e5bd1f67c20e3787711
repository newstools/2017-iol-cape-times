A traumatised family member who withheld her name said they received a call at 3am to identify the body. “It is really sad news to wake up to, especially during this time of the year. “We received a call from an eyewitness who did not give her name. She said two cars were dicing in Merrydale Road while he was in the oncoming lane. "The first car hit him, causing him to lose balance, and then the second car hit him and his car swerved off the road to hit a tree, and he broke his neck,” she said. “We had just finished preparing for a 60th celebration for a family member earlier that day (Saturday). We were asleep when we received the call. "When we arrived at the scene his car was still there but his body had already been moved to the mortuary. “Yesterday (Sunday) at around noon we went to the police for documentation, and then we went to go and identify his body,” she said. Police spokesperson Nothemba Pinkie Batwa said that on Sunday about 12.35am Mitchells Plain police attended a complaint where two vehicles had collided in Merrydale Road. “A male aged 62 died in the collision.
