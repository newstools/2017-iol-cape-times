Setlaleleng, who has been with SAA for more than 18 years, has found a unique and entertaining way to raise awareness about the water-saving crisis.  Part of his message is encouraging people to shower together.  “When you’re speaking, you have to be creative to catch people’s attention.  When they are getting ready to land, passengers will be thinking about the journey ahead, but a joke will get their attention,” laughed Setlaleleng. “After he gets passengers’ attention with greetings in up to 20 languages, Setlaleleng puts his own spin on the airline’s official water savings message,” said Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde’s spokesperson, Bronwynne Jooste.  “Many times, as we are disembarking, passengers will come up to me and 
say they had heard something about the 
water crisis before travelling to the 
Western Cape, and they appreciated 
the advice on how they can save,” he 
said.  Winde personally thanked Setleleleng for his efforts by rewarding him with a certificate. “Zanda has a special way of conveying the message. He gets your attention from the start, and people are talking about him,” he said.  Anton Bredell, the MEC of Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, said: “We all need to be water heroes.” The Western Cape’s Water Hero initiative is a joint campaign between Winde and Bredell.    argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
