Beaches in Plettenberg Bay were closed for public safety this week. “The public are urged to adhere to local municipal authority warnings and go to beaches only where and when lifeguards are on duty, obey the lifeguards' safety instructions, and swim between the red and yellow flags posted by lifeguards. Leave the water if instructed to do so,” said the NSRI.  Shark Spotters chief executive Sarah Waries yesterday said two shark were spotted in Muizenberg at the weekend, but so far shark activity had been relatively quiet. Waries said that did not mean people should not be on alert. The NSRI said it and emergency services were well prepared to deal with incidents and carry emergency medical shark kits. These are kept on all rescue boats and on NSRI rescue vehicles. Earlier this year, a teenager was bitten by a shark while surfing at Plettenberg Bay. The 14-year-old was surfing with two other surfers when he felt a bump and then felt a bite on his right calf.
