The Cape Times Fresh Air Camp at Froggy Pond, Simon’s Town, provides an unforgettable experience for boys and girls, who, for a whole week, get to play games, eat, swim and sing. At the eight camps a year, the children also learn life-skills and life-saving skills.  Most importantly, they get to take a break from their harsh environments and just be children. This week the camp will host about 100 girls from various areas in Cape Town. Recruiters work with the provincial department of social development, schools and churches to select children who will benefit from some time at the beach.
