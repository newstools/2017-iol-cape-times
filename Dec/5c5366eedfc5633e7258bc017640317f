Tango, with a head bowed down while Henney read out his fate, was immediately taken back to Pollsmoor prison where he will serve his sentences.  Tango pleaded guilty to the heinous crime in court last week and said he did it “because he did not want to go to jail for it”.  Stacha’s mother, Sandy Markgraaf, couldn’t hold back the tears knowing that Tango, who helped searched for her body just after she went missing, would pay for his crimes. 
“Now our healing can finally begin,” she said. Tango, a father of two children, was also handed 10 years imprisonment for the rape of a minor who was under age of legal consent at the time he raped her.
The victim was only 14 years old at the time of the incident and has since given birth to Tango’s child. Tango confessed to the murder of Stacha and said he strangled her before dumping her lifeless body on a field in Tafelsig, Mitchells Plain.    Facebook    Twitter
