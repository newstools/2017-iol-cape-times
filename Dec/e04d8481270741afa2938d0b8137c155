The charges against Ismail Esau followed an investigation into a complaint that he put up posters that allegedly targeted visiting pupils and teachers from Herzlia High School, according to the provincial Education Department. An online petition in support of Esau calling for the charges to be dropped continued gaining momentum yesterday with more than 1 000 people throwing their weight behind him. However, the department said there was a complaint that Esau put up posters that allegedly targeted visiting pupils and teachers from Herzlia High School. The department confirmed that Esau had not been suspended and that a pre-hearing meeting was held to finalise arrangements for the disciplinary hearing due to start tomorrow. Esau supporters say they would picket outside the department’s offices. One of his supporters, Hanif Loonat, said Esau believed he had a democratic right do what he had done.  “Our country’s constitution allows freedom of speech and what he said in those four posters is nothing wrong. Everything he says there is true. He is not attacking Judaism, he says we respect Judaism,” said Loonat. “We believe this is a test to see if the national government is going to allow this type of obstruction, not allowing us as citizens of this country to voice our discontent on oppression throughout the world.” Provincial Education Department spokesperson Paddy Attwell said: “In terms of the Employment of Educators Act, misconduct includes discriminating against another person on the basis of religion, belief, culture and political opinion, among other grounds.”
