Ntuli, a lawyer with a Bachelor of Laws degree (LLB), succeeded in the rigorous selection process to be part of the third cohort of this scholarship that attracted more than 4000 applicants. Those selected comprise students from 39 countries and 97 universities, with 41% from the US, 20% from China and 39% from the rest of the world. The scholars will enrol at Schwarzman College for a Master’s degree programme at the Tsinghua University campus in Beijing in August. Ntuli is currently completing his first master’s degree in Private Law and Human Rights at the University of Cape Town as a Mandela Rhodes Scholar. He holds a law degree from the University of the Free State. On his facebook timeline Ntuli posted that he was “profoundly humbled and immensely delighted” to be selected. “Notwithstanding, I am confident I won’t be the last,” wrote Ntuli. He said the scholarship was created to respond to the geopolitical landscape of the 21st century and designed to prepare the next generation of leaders, whether in business, law, science or politics.  “Undoubtedly a rare and golden opportunity to be exposed to new cultures and perspectives,” he said. “I hope to maximise the experience, opportunities and networks for the betterment of society.”  The Schwartzman Scholarship founder, Stephen A Schwarzman, said: “Meeting these people from all over the world, who at such a young age have already started to make an impact in their respective fields, has been truly inspiring.” The scholars were selected through a rigorous application process designed to evaluate proven intellectual and academic ability, as well as leadership potential and strength of character.  Global director of admissions Robert Garris said: “Our next class brings together another group of young leaders who have demonstrated ability to bridge differences in background, professions, and perspectives through their leadership on campus and in the workplace.”   Facebook    Twitter
