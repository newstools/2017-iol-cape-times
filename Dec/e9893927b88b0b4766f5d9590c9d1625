Proceedings needed to be moved to a bigger courtroom to accommodate those representing both the Cape Town Minstrel Carnival Association (CTMCA) and the Kaapse Klopse Karnival Assosiasie (KKKA). Addressing the packed gallery, Judge Langa said that there was insufficient time prior to January competitions to reconsider the CTMCA’s application or to entertain a new application by it for a permit. “The applicant has simply failed in its application for a permit and has itself to blame. It is clear that from the onset the applicant was aware of the requirements but failed to comply.  "Any remedy by the court which does not take the position of the second respondent (KKKA) into account will result in unfairness,” he said. Judge Langa dismissed with costs the CTMCA’s application. The CTMCA had accused the City of Cape Town, SAPS and the KKKA of corruption, fraud and spitefulness for denying them the use of the stadium for their minstrel competitions this year. The City approved R6.1 million for upcoming minstrel events and Malay choirs, of which R4.1m would be cash to associations, and R2m for support services. Last month the CTMCA’s application was struck from the roll with costs by Judge Robert Henney who said CTMCA  had provided no evidence to back up its allegations. CTMCA  chief executive Kevin Momberg said: “Those wishing to remove us from the equation have succeeded. They are stealing away our sports and we hope they are satisfied because more than 30 000 people are going to suffer because of this.” KKKA  director Muneeb Gambeno said their intent was to return this carnival to the people by showcasing the true heroes of carnival, that being the communities who "live and drive carnival". He said they remained open to all troupes and the road march was free. Troupes could indicate participation by signing the participation forms.
