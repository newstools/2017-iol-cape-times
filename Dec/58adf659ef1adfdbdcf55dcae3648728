This comes ahead of the RCS Gugulethu Reconciliation Race in partnership with the Cape Times, which Mol will be taking part in with his family on Saturday at the NY49 Gugulethu Stadium. Mol said that years ago he had the opportunity to interview Amy’s mom, and how her forgiveness of her daughter’s killers was an example of  “grace, progress, forgiveness and reconciliation”. Mol, who will be participating in the 4.2km fun run with his family, said the best tip he could give is to go into the race expecting to have fun. “It is about promoting health. Through exercising you are able to cure many things. Running is far more inclusive and unified because everyone can run. ‘‘It is not like cycling because not everyone has a bicycle but running, everyone is more than likely to do it. I am all for health and exercise. I often tell (my) audiences that exercising combats and cures depression. “For every runner, when you run your body produces happy hormones. Happy hormones have a healthy effect that (moderates) modern depression. ‘‘It just shows the value of what our bodies do when we exercise. So come and run.  You will feel great and feel like a member of a much broader reconciliation,” he said. Mol advised people not to over-exert themselves at the beginning of the race. “Do not start too quickly during the race. Start slow but make the most of it and have fun,” he said. Tickets for the RCS Gugulethu Reconciliation Race are available on www.entrytime.com as well as at the gate.  lonwabo.marele@inl.co.za
