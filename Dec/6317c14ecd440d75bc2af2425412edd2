This after the drivers’ union, the United National Transport Union (Untu), said yesterday it had declared a dispute to force the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) to restore safety regulations on trains in the Western Cape within 48 hours. The union had threatened to embark on a strike on Monday if Prasa did not adhere to its demand. The train drivers had told their union that more tracks on the 
Central line were not functional after the service was reinstated on Wednesday. Metrorail had suspended its services earlier this week following vandalism, cable theft and destruction of infrastructure. Untu general secretary Steve Harris said the dispute was declared because Prasa continued to not comply with safety regulations. He said their members were so traumatised by the constant exposure to danger that arrangements were made with trauma counsellors to debrief them yesterday. Approached for comment, Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said: “Prasa (Metrorail leadership) has agreed to withdraw the suspension and to engage with the Untu regional leadership on their concerns as agreed between the parties.” However, when this was put to Untu, Harris said he was not aware of any agreement. “I can assure you that the regional guys, Mr Brian Davies has ensured us... he asked for the dispute to be declared and we declared this morning (Thursday).” Scott would not say how many drivers were suspended.
