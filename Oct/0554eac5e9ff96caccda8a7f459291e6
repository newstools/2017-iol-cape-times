At the weekend commuter Lerato Mokoena posted on social media that a group of Metrorail employees boarded a train at Goodwood station before 9am, with one woman in possession of a yellow box ticket dispenser. “You could smell the alcohol on them. All of them were drunk, they were making a lot of noise. The one guy could not even stand straight, he was smelling of alcohol,” she said. Mokoena described the staff’s behaviour as “aggressive”. “One passenger didn’t have a ticket, and they literally manhandled her, they pulled her by the collar and put her off the train,” she added. Mokoena said passengers did not confront the employees, as they did not want to be handled in the same way the woman had been. After she posted about the incident, Mokoena says she was told that someone from Metrorail would contact her, but no one had done so days after the incident. “It is appalling that these staff that were verifying tickets on the 3514 (train) were drunk,” she said. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said the matter was reported and an internal investigation was under way to establish the facts. “Allegations of poor service and/or behaviour are concerning and we encourage commuters to report such (incidents) immediately to station/area/customer services managers so that it can be investigated and disciplinary action brought against the non-performers,” Scott said. Employees and contractors were aware that their behaviour is under public scrutiny and that they would be subjected to Prasa’s disciplinary code should non-conformance be proven, Scott said.
