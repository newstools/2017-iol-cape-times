Fisheries Deputy Director General Siphokazi Ndudane’s response (“Putting reality, complexity of fisheries management into perspective”, October 1) to Professor Cochrane’s opinion piece on rock lobster includes encouraging aspects. The plans to improve compliance to curb illegal fishing and re-establish the Green (environmental) courts signal thoughtful leadership and would certainly assist recover rock lobster if implemented. However, Ndudane and Cochrane remain at odds on a critical aspect. Ndudane argues passionately that negative social and economic consequences of a rock lobster quota reduction require DAFF to consider set a catch higher than is biologically sustainable. She further underscores the unfairness in the current reality facing bona fide legal fishers. Presently, illegal fishing (mainly by organised criminals) depletes resources at the expense of honest fishers. This is unjust. But would it not be more unjust if the rock lobster resource were knowingly, severely overfished with the consent of the government? There are also considerations on whether this is permissible under South African Law. Furthermore, such a course of action could signal the end any significant fishing of rock lobster. Namibia’s sardine stock crashed in the 1970s after severe overfishing. About 40 years later, the stock has not recovered, probably because the heavy fishing changed the ecosystem. The same could happen to the already heavily depleted rock lobster. This entirely plausible outcome should be taken seriously. The challenge faced by Ndudane is daunting, involving multiple segments of society, organised crime and market forces. Solutions require pooling of all available knowledge and expertise from both within and outside the Fisheries Department. Therefore one hopes DDG Ndudane will work together with Professor Cochrane to urgently convene a working group of lobster fishery stakeholders and seasoned experts to try to solve the current crisis.
