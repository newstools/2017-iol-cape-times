The Heher commission's report on its inquiry into the feasibility of making higher education and training fee-free in South Africa could be released before the end of next week, the Presidency said on Saturday. Following widespread and sometimes violent protests by students at universities and other higher education institutions around the country, President Jacob Zuma appointed the commission - chaired by Judge Arthur Heher, assisted by advocate Gregory Ally and Leah Thembisile Khumalo - on January 14, 2016. The commission was expected to complete its work within an 18-month period, Zuma's spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga said. However, the commission could not finish its work within the 18-month period and Zuma extended its term until June 30, 2017. Zuma had received the final report from the commission on August 30, 2017. The Presidency had been "working on the report" since the date it was received. "The Presidency is now finalising the processing of the report which requires, among other things, that the presidency consult with the relevant ministers to ensure that government is ready to implement the presidentâ€™s decision as as soon he releases the report. "The consultations with relevant ministries is at an advanced stage and it is expected that it will be finalised during the course of next week. "The president will release the report immediately thereafter," Ngqulunga said. African News Agency
