The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor was shut down by Barbara Hogan in 2010 after R10 billion had been spent. Now Eskom is at it again and at the very moment that Parliament is hearing horrendous stories about its being significantly repurposed as a state institution to facilitate massive looting. As much as one trillion rand is reputed to have evaporated. It is an affront to us all, to have the Department of Energy granting Eskom permission to build a new nuclear power plant at Duynefontein. Dave Nicholls, Eskom’s chief nuclear officer, can enthuse all he wants. There should be no takers from the people of Cape Town. We should give it a universal and thunderous “no”. Brian Molefe can get a R30m golden handshake for 18 months  from Eskom. We pay and Eskom  plays. If Cope is part of the next coalition government it will unequivocally support renewable energy programmes only. It will also expedite support for all those companies that have been queueing for a long while now, with their billions, to invest in wind and solar energy. Eskom and the ANC government are being grossly unfair in not signing agreements with them as had been promised. Government won’t give the go-ahead for what is ready, affordable and environmentally desirable. However, it is hell-bent on pushing ahead at breakneck speed for something that must still happen somewhere in the future, at monstrous cost and which will eventually loom over us as a nuclear fallout risk. No thanks! Those in Cape Town who are apathetic about state capture and climate change can continue to remain indifferent and unconcerned. On the other hand, civic-minded people who want green, safe, reliable and cheaper electricity should vehemently object  to having a nuclear plant at Duynefontein. Farouk Cassim ​MP​ (Cope)
