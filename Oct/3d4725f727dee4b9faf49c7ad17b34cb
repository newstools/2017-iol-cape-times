Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has authorised an "offer" to the South African Post Office (Sapo) to take over the payment of social grants. In a late statement on Wednesday, Dlamini's department said it had agreed with recommendations from acting South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) chief executive Pearl Bengu after a closed procurement process. "Sassa has given Sapo an offer and has given them a reasonable time to respond. This is also after due diligence was conducted on Sapo," the statement said. "Sassa has been hard at work under the leadership of the Department of Social Development and the Minister of Social Development in trying to find the best solution for the payment of social grants." No further details of the offer have been released. African News Agency
