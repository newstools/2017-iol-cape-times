There is an urgent need to explore alternate water sources to avoid  day zero here and in the rest of the country. There are three understandings that could be attributed to the drought prevailing in the Western Cape. – The one would be inadequate rainfall in this winter season – but this is an acute abnormality. – The second would be that the inadequate rainfall this winter season is more of a chronic condition and a shift of seasonal effects of climate change – where the rainfall pattern would change to late winter, early spring and the longer term would be early summer rainfall. – The third would be the rate of climate change is not fast and that the rainfall is non-disruptive and the winter rainfall would resume after the disruptive seasons as in a 1:100 year projections. Accordingly, the smart approach would be to urgently explore the use of alternative sources to decrease reliance on surface water systems (rainfall). The recycling of the partially treated final effluent through desalination or ultra-filtration process may yield additional water. The drilling of boreholes where there is potential can complement the water mix thus leading to sustainable water supply during this water- stressed period. The department agrees with  the belief that almost total reliance on rainfall cannot be condoned  any longer. Alternative sources of water must be sourced urgently, wastage must stop and proper use of water must be undertaken without any further delay. “Water is life, sanitation is dignity”.
