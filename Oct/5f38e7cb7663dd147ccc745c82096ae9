Police spokesperson André Traut said the two suspects would appear on murder charges in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court today. Traut said four suspects were initially questioned, but two were released, as they could not be linked to the crime. “Detectives worked around the clock gathering physical forensic clues, which has prompted the arrest of the suspects.” Two men, 32 and 34, have been charged and are due in court. “The 29- and 41-year-old males have been released as they cannot be linked to the crime,” said Traut. The McCrawl home was cordoned off as a crime scene on Monday while a police forensic team collected evidence, including blood splatters in a backyard dwelling. The 10-year-old went missing last Thursday and her body was found on the Vygies
kraal riverbank on Friday. According to information obtained by the Cape Times, Chanelle didn’t attend school on Thursday. When she did not return from her after-school programme that day, she was reported missing. On Friday, her grandmother made the gruesome discovery.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za  Cape Times
