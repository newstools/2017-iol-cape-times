Four people were injured on Wednesday morning when a minibus taxi and light motor vehicle collided into a supporting concrete pillar of a building in Wynberg, causing the balcony, where a woman was standing, to collapse. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said the collision happened at the corner of Main and Wilson roads in Wynberg. When paramedics arrived at about 7am they found a taxi and a car on the side of the road, Meiring said. He added that a balcony which had stood over the pavement lay crumbled below with rubble strewn in the street. “Paramedics assessed one woman who had been standing on the balcony at the time and found that she had sustained moderate injuries. "Three women from the taxi were assessed and found to have sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate,” said Meiring. He said the injured were treated before they were taken to a nearby provincial hospital. Both drivers escaped injury. Local authorities are investigating the cause of the crash. African News Agency
