The Congress of the People (Cope) notes software company SAP’s announcement on Thursday regarding the outcome of an internal investigation, following allegations that kickbacks were paid to a Gupta front company to secure massive contracts with Transnet. Cope notes SAP’s admission of misconduct and that it has reported the matter to US authorities in terms of the US’s corrupt activities legislation. SAP’s admissions are further irrefutable evidence corroborating the findings of state capture made in SACC’s and Academics' reports, which were validated by the leaked e-mails. But Cope must question the silence and lack of action by our own authorities, including the Hawks and the NPA, and, more particularly, the actions and inaction of the president regarding state capture. As Judge President Dunstan Mlambo noted to the president's advocate in the Johannesburg High Court, the president has known of serious allegations of state capture, involving our state and himself, for close to 18 months since the public protector wrote to him, and yet he has done nothing. As the judge president posed somewhat rhetorically: "Is this the conduct that one would expect from a reasonable president of a constitutional democracy?" Zuma's continued occupation of the presidency is now no longer tenable. End! Glacier Nkhwashu Cope communication officer
