The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) on Friday said it gave President Jacob Zuma until November 30 to make representations on why corruption charges against him should be dropped. "The NDPP (National Director of Public Prosecutions) is of the view that in light of the judgment of the SCA, it appears that any further representations envisaged by Mr Zuma should relate to issues not previously considered," the NPA said. "As a result, Mr Zuma has been advised through his lawyers that he has until 30 November, 2017 to submit any envisaged representations to the NDPP." On October 13, the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) dismissed with costs the appeal by Zuma and the NPA in the spy tapes saga. SCA Justice Eric Leach upheld the cCourt’s decision to withdraw 783 charges of corruption and fraud against Zuma was irrational, saying the ruling to terminate the decision not to prosecute cannot be faulted. Leach said the manner in which the case was conducted on behalf of the NPA was inexcusable. Zuma and the NPA asked for leave to appeal a judgement of the Gauteng North High Court last year, which ruled in favour of the Democratic Alliance, setting aside the 2009 decision by the NPA’s former NDPP Mokotedi Mpshe to discontinue the corruption case against Zuma on the basis of irrationality.
