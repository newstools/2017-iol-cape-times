On Monday, forensic pathologist Akmal Khan, for the State,  sited numerous concerns regarding a post-mortem report by the defence’s pathologist, Reggie Perumal, a week after Susan Rohde died. Susan died last July. It was initially believed that she had hanged herself on the bathroom door of her hotel room at the Spier Wine Estate. However, police later opened a murder investigation and her husband was charged. In Rohde’s plea explanation he admits that he and his wife had a confrontation that morning and subsequent to that she went to the bathroom. Khan said the cause of death was lack of oxygen, following manual strangulation and smothering. “The cause of death, the injuries to her neck are not explained through the confrontation version of events. The injuries to knuckles, legs can also be from altercation. This does, however, not explain injuries to her neck.” Khan said Perumal overlooked injuries to Susan's neck, which were important to determine that she was strangled by hand. He said Perumal did not request photographs of Susan's body before completing the post-mortem and making dissections. “The injuries on Susan's neck has been overlooked, which might change the cause of death concluded by the post-mortem. “To reconstruct a neck dissection for a second autopsy is impossible, photographs are hence necessary. Pathologists can possibly not come to definitive conclusion without photographs of first dissection.” The pathologist told the court that one of the important differences between the State's report and the defence’s pathology expert's report was in the tearing found in the neck. "How could Perumal complete a post-mortem on the neck if he doesn't know in what condition the tissue was in before dissection?" Pete Mahalik, Rohde’s defence lawyer, was given until tomorrow to consult his expert. Cross-examinations of Khan would then resume.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
