The hearing was postponed until November 1 after State prosecutor Helene Booysen was unable to attend proceedings yesterday at the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court. Tasliem Bianchi, Ikeraam Bianchi, Marlon Neehuis, Kelly Daniels and Kimberley Solomons are accused of the murder. Daniels previously sought to move to the hospital section of Pollsmoor Prison as she is pregnant. Two additional charges – possession of an unlicensed firearm and possession of ammunition – were added to the charge sheet when they appeared in September. Ezra was killed in a gang drive-by shooting on September 3. It was previously submitted by prosecutor Booysen that the five were occupants of a white vehicle from which one shot was fired which fatally wounded the boy. The child was shot in his neck – metres away from where another child was killed in February last year – and died on the scene. Jayden Boltman, 10, was shot when gunmen ran through his home, opening fire and killing the youngster. During September Booysen also said the State was still awaiting crime scene photographs, ballistics reports, forensic information and post-mortem results. She said the State would be opposing bail. A petition, drawn up by Parkwood residents and organisations was signed by more than 200 people objecting to bail for the accused.
