National Professional Teachers’ Organisation of SA (Naptosa), along with advocacy group Equal Education (EE), said they planned to march to Parliament, with the former planning to hand over a memorandum of demands. Naptosa said: “Naptosa is extremely concerned about the ongoing and apparently increasing incidents of violence on Western Cape school premises. These include shootings, stabbings, other violence, and intimidation.” Naptosa said the issue was “too big” for the provincial education department to handle alone. At 3pm today EE Western Cape is expected to host a mass action to call for #SafeSchools, #SafeCommunities and equitable distribution of #PoliceResources. They will march from Keizersgracht to Parliament. “EE will be marching to call for our provincial and national government to provide the resources and capacity necessary to make Western Cape schools and communities safer for all. "For this march, EE will be partnering with Social Justice Coalition, Nyanga Community Policing Forum, National Professional Teachers’ Organisation of South Africa, South African Democratic Teachers’ Union and #UniteBehind, along with its affiliates.” This action comes after the ANCYL Dullah Omar Region earlier this week lodged a complaint with the SA Human Rights Commission about the issue. “The killing of young people in schools in Cape Town is becoming a norm and happens during each school year,” ANCYL regional co-ordinator Roscoe Jacobs said. Education MEC Debbie Schäfer’s spokesperson, Jessica Shelver, said they were doing as much as they could as an education department to protect schools. “We simply do not have the legislative mandate, security manpower or budget to guarantee learner safety from gang violence. "The reality is that without more police presence, gang violence cannot be brought under control,” Shelver said.
