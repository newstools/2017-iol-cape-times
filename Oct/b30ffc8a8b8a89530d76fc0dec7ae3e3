This is the second case considered a victory for the fight against child murders in the province since the beginning of this year. Last Wednesday, in Mitchells Plain, the rape and murder case against Randy Tango was also referred to the high court. Tango is implicated in the murder of Stacha Arendse whose naked body was found dumped on a soccer field hours after she was reported missing on March 27 in Tafelsig. His trial will start on November 20. Supporters and family of murdered 3-year-old, Courtney Pieters, cheered on Friday as they heard Saunders would appear in the high court on November 24 for a pre-trial hearing. His trial is set to start on February 5. Saunders, devoid of emotion during previous  proceedings, on Friday for the first time looked at the gallery and scoffed while cheers erupted. People in the gallery hurled expletives at Saunders as he was led down to the holding cells. He faces one charge of rape and one of murder. Courtney's mother, Juanita Pieters, was not in court on Friday as she is hospitalised. It is the first time Pieters missed a court date. Courtney’s father and Pieters’ partner, Aaron Fourie, said he wanted to “choke” Saunders when he saw him but also expressed relief that the case was making progress. “I wanted to jump over the bench and just choke him just knowing what he did to my child. Juanita is not doing well. The stress of this case is getting to her,” he said. Courtney disappeared from her home in Pluto Street, Elsies River, on May 4. Her body was found nine days later, buried in a shallow grave at Bofors Circle, Epping Industria, near her home. Saunders was arrested a day later.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
