CAPE TOWN - Mango Airlines flights will return to normal on Saturday after the both the airline and trade union Solidarity on Friday confirmed a wage agreement had been reached. The agreement, which was struck on Thursday evening, comes after pilots went on strike on Monday morning demanding a higher pay increase. Solidarity deputy secretary, Deon Reyneke, said the Mango management had offered a “solution-driven approach” which the pilots accepted. The pilots accepted a seven percent pay rise. “It was of particular importance to our members to reach an agreement that predominantly outlines the scheduling of flight rosters and hours of work Mango requires from them,”Said Reyneke. “Mango agreed to it and committed itself to bring such an agreement to the table within the next six months. This is already a step in the right direction as far as our members are concerned.” Reyneke said pilots had already started reporting for work on Friday morning. Mango said in a statement that flights would be running normally on Saturday. – African News Agency (ANA)
