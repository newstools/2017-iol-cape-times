The festival is a cultural appreciation and fundraising event for the whole family, packed with all things Portuguese including food, culture and music. Supporters were also treated to folk dancing and live bands. Co-ordinator Alberto Goncalves said the event is a traditional one and marks the start of the fishing season. “The event is held to bless the boats and fishermen who go out to sea each year and has become somewhat of a social event. It is also held as a fundraising event for Portuguese welfare,” he said. Goncalves said the event grows every year with more people interested in, and supporting, the event. Yesterday at Jetty 2 opposite the Table Bay Hotel a service was held followed by the blessing of the boats and then a boat procession out to sea. “Normally we have about 10 or 15 boats out here but, because we hosted the event a week later this year, other fishermen have already gone out to sea. Today we did the blessing of about six boats,” he said. Goncalves said they intended to host a big event next year as it will be the 30th anniversary of the festival being hosted in Cape Town. “We will have to see if we can get more space allocated to us next year, seeing as the event has grown so much,” he said, adding they get a lot of support from the locals. “Although we are Portuguese, sometimes we feel more South African than Portuguese,” Goncalves said. “Our South African families look forward to the festival every year as well. They have been a great support. "Because we’re inter-married, the community has grown and we are a very open community,” he said.
