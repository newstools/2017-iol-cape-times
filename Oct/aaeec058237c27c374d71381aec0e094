10-year-old Charnelle McCrawl. On Monday, police and forensics cordoned
off the home where Charnelle, endearingly known as Nellie, to gather more evidence
in hopes of making a positive arrest. "I am glad for the quick response from
police as evidence comes in. Since Friday, they have been working hard to
arrests the perpetrators," she said. According to reports, a relative was
arrested after CCTV footage was viewed. A resident described Nellie as a humble
girl who "loved playing with babies and always had a smile on her
face".  “She was a lovely girl and she was
well-behaved. There were never any complaints of her at the school,” she said. “Since she was three years old, she has
been involved with the church and did spiritual dancing. The group that she
used to dance with, did a dance item in her honour after her body was found on
Friday,” she said. Cape Times
