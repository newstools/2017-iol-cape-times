A cousin of two men accused of raping and murdering Khayelitsha resident Sinoxolo Mafevuka testified at the Western Cape High Court on Wednesday that one of the accused, Xolisa Mafilika, was sleeping at the time of the murder. Sinoxolo Mafevuka, 19, was found dead in a communal toilet in SST 2 Block, Town Two, in Khayelitsha on March 2, 2016. She was naked and her clothes had been stuffed in the toilet cistern. The State alleges that she was murdered after 10pm. Defence witness Luvo Mafilika, 20, said his cousin Xolisa arrived at the home they shared before 10pm and slept there the whole night. Luvo said he was the one who opened for Xolisa when he came home on the night of March 1, 2016. Had Xolisa gone outside the shack, Luvo said, he would have known because the bolt they used to lock them inside was noisy and Xolisa passes through his room when getting out. Luvo also disputed that some clothing and sunglasses found at the scene were that of Xolisa. “I don’t know these sunglasses (and) I never saw accused one wearing them,” said Luvo. Luvo said he last saw Mafevuka the previous Friday or Saturday before he was told of her death the following Wednesday. Although Mafevuka was dating Luvo’s cousin Viwe, he only knew her by sight and never had a conversation with her. But State prosecutor Ralph Zeeman put it to Luvo that he only remembers what was important to the accused. “I want to put it to you that you will say anything to assist the accused,” said Zeeman. To which Luvo responded that he was telling the court what he knows.
