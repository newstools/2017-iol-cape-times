The male suspects were in a train en route to Cape Town. They were caught trying to set fire to train seats between Salt River and Woodstock station. Neither of the men had a valid train ticket either, says Metrorail’s Regional Manager, Richard Walker. “The latest arrests follow shortly after a 26-year-old Bonteheuwel man was arrested on Friday [13 October] in Salt River for vandalising a coach. We ensure that SAPS file charges in terms of the Criminal Matters Amendment Act [CMAA]. It is senseless to destroy trains that commuters rely on. Unless criminals are stopped in their tracks, we will continue to fight a losing battle,” Walker said. “The suspects were handed over by security to the Cape Town Rapid Response Rail Unit and are detained at Woodstock SAPS. Charges of malicious damage to property were opened and prosecution will be in terms in the CMAA.” He urged members of the 
public to come forward with knowledge of criminals who are crippling the railway service. “I again encourage the public to be part of the solution by reporting criminals whose deeds continue to scupper reliable rail services. Full anonymity of the source is guaranteed and a reward of up to R25 000 is payable for any information leading to a conviction,” Walker added. Daily Voice
