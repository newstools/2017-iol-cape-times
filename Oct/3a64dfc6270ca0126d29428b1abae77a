Tutu’s arch was unveiled on the Nobel Peace laureate’s 86th birthday on Saturday after Cape Town mayor Patricia De Lille asked Design Indaba to conceptualise a tribute to the stalwart and former Truth and Reconciliation Committee chairperson. At the unveiling De Lille said Tutu continued to “speak truth to power” even after the advent of democracy. Naidoo said the structure consisted of 14 individual arched beams made of wood, which together form a dome. The pillars symbolise the 14 chapters of the constitution. “Straddling the country’s oldest avenue, the arch connects St George’s Cathedral to Parliament. Much like the “Arch” himself is a man of the holy book and a man of justice, which in our country is represented by our constitution.” An arch was usually held together by a keystone, which if removed would collapse the structure, Naidoo said. South Africa's constitution was its keystone. “We hope the parliamentarians will view this arch every day and remember that, and the integrity and resilience with which our constitution was forged. "There is also free wi-fi at the site with which we will use to provide visitors with information about the Arch and our constitution.” Naidoo said that besides the relevant government departments, archaeologists and tree experts were consulted to ensure the artwork did not affect the tree life or any heritage findings during the construction. The prototype launched at Design Indaba in March would be installed at the gardens of the Constitutional Court in Joburg on December 10, commemorating the 21st anniversary of the adoption of the constitution.
