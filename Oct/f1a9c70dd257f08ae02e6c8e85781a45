Partnership policing showed its strength in Nyanga on Saturday morning when a 37-year-old suspect was arrested shortly after he and his accomplices hijacked a liquor delivery vehicle, Western Cape police said. "A vigilant motorist witnessed the hijacking in Govan Mbeki Road, Philippi, and flagged down a police patrol," Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said. The motorist accompanied the SAPS officers and shortly afterwards the vehicle was spotted in Browns Farm nearby. "The suspects stopped the vehicle and fled further on foot while one of them fired shots at police, fortunately missing the members. He was arrested and his firearm was confiscated. The stolen vehicle was also recovered. "While the suspect is scheduled to make a court appearance in Athlone [Magistrate's Court] on Monday. we are in hot pursuit of the other two [hijackers] who managed to evade their arrest. "We are grateful for the assistance we receive from the public to fight crime and community partnerships are highly valued," Traut said. African News Agency
