 Preparation time: 30 mins Ready time: 30 mins  Ingredients: For the pastry: 1 cup coconut flakes 1 cup oat flour Pinch salt 1 tbs lemon zest 1 cup dates 2 tbs melted coconut oil 2-4 tbs water  For the filling: 3 cups soaked cashews Pinch salt 1 tsp vanilla essence ½ cup lemon juice ¾ cup melted coconut oil ¼ cup melted cacao butter Method To make the pastry: Blend the coconut and oat flour into a fine flour. Add the salt, lemon and optional superfoods until well distributed. Add the dates and hold on to your blender. Once the dates are well distributed, very gradually add the oil then water until you can squeeze the mixture into a ball. Press into a lined tart tin.  To make the filling: Blend all ingredients apart from the melted oils. When the mixture needs some help, add the melted oils and blend until smooth. Check for lemon flavour. Split the mixture in half and add turmeric to the half in the blender. Pour into your pastry case in a creative way. In this version, we add one teaspoon of turmeric cream, and one teaspoon of lemon to the centre of the tart, one by one, to form layers. Set overnight in the fridge. This will keep for a week, if it's not all eaten before then!
