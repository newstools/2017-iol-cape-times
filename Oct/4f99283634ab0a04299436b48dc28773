Johannesburg – Legendary South African jazz musician Hugh Masekela has cancelled all commitments for the immediate future as he battles prostate cancer and asked the public for privacy, local media reported the musician saying late on Friday, in what he described as the only statement he would make publicly on the matter. “I have cancelled my commitments for the immediate future as I will need all my energy to continue this fight against prostate cancer,” said Masekela who has been under treatment for the cancer since 2008. “This will be the only public statement I make on the matter, and I ask for privacy going forward, so that I may rest and heal." Addressing “Friends and Media”, Masekela urged all men to have regular tests to prevent the spread of prostate cancer going unchecked.
