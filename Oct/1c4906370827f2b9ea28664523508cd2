Johannesburg - An Eskom lawyer caught threatening and insulting a journalist has been dismissed, the power utility said on Saturday. This after a video surfaced on Friday showing the evidence leader in suspended chief executive officer Matshela Koko's disciplinary hearing, Sebetja Matsaung, threatening to deal with a journalist. In the video posted by reporter Karyn Maughan, a visibly angry Matsaung confronts Business Day journalist Sikhonathi Mantshantsha for allegedly branding him a liar. "You see me here sweet and smiling and you think I'm a liar. I will take you out now boss, the African way. "I sort out my own problems... man-to-man I will sort you out now chief."    Matsaung then goes on to repeatedly insult Mantshantsha, labelling him a "disgrace" and unqualified to be a journalist. The video has since made the rounds on social media, with Matsaung's conduct being slammed by Twitter users. Mantshantsha has since spoken out following the incident, tweeting that he was safe and that Matsaung has since called and apologised for attacking him. Eskom in a statement confirmed it had terminated Matsaung's services following the incident.    "Eskom condemns Matsaung's behaviour in the strongest terms possible. We wish to convey our unreserved apologies that this unfortunate incident occured. The power utility added that the Koko's hearing, which was due to resume on Monday, will be postponed while a new evidence leader is appointed. IOL
