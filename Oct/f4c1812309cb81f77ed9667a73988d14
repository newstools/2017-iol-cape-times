Johannesburg - Two friends of former deputy higher education minister, Mduduzi Manana - who resigned his job after admitting to beating up a woman at a night spot in Fourways, on Friday appeared before the Randburg Magistrate's Court, on charges of assault for their role in the shameless attack. The incident in which three women were attacked at Cubana, a nightclub in Fourways, happened on a weekend in August during the early hours. A video clip of Manana and his buddies beating up the women went viral on social media resulting in a public outcry and calls for the deputy minister's resignation. Manana, who was not present to support his friends on Friday, pleaded guilty to three counts of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm three weeks ago. He is out on R5 000 bail as he awaits his sentence. Cyril Madonsela, 35, and Thulani Mdaka, 30, were in the dock for two counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm for assaulting Mandisa Duma, Thina Mopipa and Noluthando Mahlaba. Asked how they plead by Magistrate Naidoo both men said: "I plead guilty". As a result of their plea, Madonsela and Mdaka were found guilty and the matter was postponed to November 7 for pre-sentencing. African News Agency
