ANC branches were holding meetings in the run-up to the party's conference in order for members to nominate their preferred candidates to succeed Jacob Zuma. ANC Western Cape secretary Faiez Jacobs said he had not yet received reports on branch general meetings. “We have to complete 190 branch meetings in the next few weeks. This weekend alone, more than 60 branches sat. I have not completed all the reports for the results. "There will be more than about 25 branches across the province that will do BGMs.” He said once all the branches had held their general meetings the province would be in a position to say who it would back for the national leadership roles. In this regard, it was too early to say whether the province would throw its weight behind Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. Jacobs said branches had until the end of the month to hold meetings. Thereafter, the provincial general council would be held. It was not the first time a branch meeting collapsed in Langa. Ward 52 members were supposed to elect a branch chairperson, deputy chairperson and nominate their preferred national leadership when chaos erupted between two factions. A faction backing former ANC treasurer Mathews Phosa allegedly disrupted the election process and caused the meeting to come to a complete stop. It is alleged that during the nomination of the deputy chairperson, members who supported Phosa switched off the lights at the venue during election proceedings. Meanwhile, the ANC's biggest branch in Durban, KwaXimba, has announced the nomination of presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, as its preferred candidate to be president of the ruling party.
