South Africa reportedly has the third highest number of cybercrime victims worldwide, losing about R2.2 billion a year to cyber attacks and it has suffered more from cyber attacks than any other African country. Tomorrow, the Businesswomen’s Association (BWA) will hold a workshop, themed “Fundamentals of Cyber Security”, aimed at preparing businesses for possible cyber attacks and to ensure that they are cyber secure in the digital world. The workshop will be addressed by the chief information officer (CIO) of Parliament, Unathi Mtya, who is studying for an Executive MA of Science in Technology Management at Columbia University. She has also had a wide range of careers, enabling her management of multi-disciplinary teams across the entire ICT spectrum. “As a leading platform for women business leaders, we aim to sensitise the business community to the impact of cyber attacks on businesses and strategies that should be adopted to mitigate against them,” said Lerato Mgidlana, chairperson of the BWA Cape Town.
