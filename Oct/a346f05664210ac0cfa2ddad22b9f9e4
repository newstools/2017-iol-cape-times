Eskom has terminated the services of its evidence leader, Sebetja Matsaung, in the disciplinary hearing of suspended Eskom acting CEO Matshela Koko, the power utility said on Saturday.
 
This followed an altercation between Matsaung and the Financial Mail’s deputy editor, Sikonathi Mantshantsha, after the hearing was adjourned on Friday, Eskom said in a statement. "Eskom condemns Matsaung’s behaviour in the strongest terms possible. We wish to convey our unreserved apologies that this unfortunate incident occurred."
 
The hearing, which was due to recommence on Monday, would be postponed until a new evidence leader was appointed. This was expected to take up to three days to finalise, the parastatal said. According to media reports, a video has emerged showing Matsaung swearing at and insulting Mantshantsha, and threatening to "take him out the African way". Koko has pleaded not guilty to six charges related to his failure to declare a conflict of interests, EWN reported. African News Agency
