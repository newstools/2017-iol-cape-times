It was a typical Cape spring day, spokesperson Marie Stinnes said, with "all four seasons" appearing on Saturday, the official beginning of the sailing season. The "Pirates of Table Bay"-themed opening cruise, including crews and boats dressing up and contending for "best dressed" prizes, was preceded by speeches at the Table Bay Yacht Club. A three-gun salute was fired by seven-pound cannons courtesy of the Cannon Society, 
then a fleet of "pirate" boats made their way into Table Bay, mustering at Granger Bay. After the sail past, the cannons of Chavonne’s Battery fired salutes to the commodore, its guests and the remaining fleet. The annual opening cruise is an opportunity for the yacht club to celebrate the new season. This year guests were addressed by Transnet planning and development manager Hlamalani Phephenyane, as well as Professor Malek Pourzanjani and Yvette de Klerk of the South African International Maritime Institute. Commodore Vitor Medina said the yacht club’s potential contribution extended to skills-building activities as part of Operation Phakisa, aimed at "unlocking" the oceans economy. The project envisages the creation of one million jobs by 2033. Phephenyane praised the sailing club’s efforts in uplifting youth from disadvantaged communities. Stinnes said a challenge the yacht club now faced was the expiration of its lease at 
the end of 2023, as well as remaining relevant to the community. In this regard, it carried out training of young people on boat construction and repairs, and these would ensure its long-term feasibility, she said.
