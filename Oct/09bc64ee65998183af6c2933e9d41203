Cousin of Pieters, Lishel Simmers, said “she is getting there day by day”. “Her health is not an easy road at the moment. She is taking it day by day. She is also definitely not wearing nappies as was reported. She asked me to please bring her sanitary towels,” Simmers said. She said Pieters, who was admitted to the Brooklyn Chest Hospital in Ysterplaat, finally met the Jacob Zuma Foundation last week and it is understood that the beneficiary papers had been signed for the home promised to her. “I’m not quite sure who picked her up that day and who she went with but no family accompanied her to the Cape Town CBD last week with the (Zuma) foundation. I’m also not sure what was discussed during the meeting. “I also did not want to pry Juanita with questions because she wasn’t feeling particularly well that day. I do understand the house is ready and is located in Delft,” Simmers said. Doctors have said Pieters is unlikely to be discharged from hospital soon. Simmers said: “On some days when I visit I can see she isn’t in very good spirits. She’s always saying she wants to go home. “At the moment it also looks like I’m the only family member visiting her. I’m not saying it’s because her family isn’t interested, it could also be due to transport. "But I have fetched the children to visit their mom. They were there this past Sunday,” she said.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
