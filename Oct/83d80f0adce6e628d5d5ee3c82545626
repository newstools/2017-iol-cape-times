City of Cape Town Speaker Dirk Smit said the amount of R700 000 which the ANC is citing, was made available for security measures to be implemented at the mayor’s residence. The full amount was not utilised, Smit said. “It is not true that R700 000 was used for renovations at the mayor’s house. An amount of approximately R451 000 was paid by council for security measures only,” he said. “Members of the ANC are misleading the media and members of the public by trying to create confusion and insinuate that the City paid for renovations. This is a lie. The City only paid for the security measures which SAPS instructed should be implemented,” he said. Smit also welcomed the ANC’s intention to approach the public protector to investigate the matter. Meanwhile Cape ANC leader, Xolani Sotashe, and about 10 ANC members again went to De Lille’s home. Sotashe has given De Lille five days to pay back the money used for security upgrades to her home. Sotashe said if De Lille does not comply they will bring the masses to picket at the City’s head offices. He said the ANC would file a complaint with the office of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to investigate the matter. “If she believes that she has paid for these renovations she is supposed to prove to everybody people are still waiting for her to prove us wrong,” said Sotashe. He vowed that the ANC would bring the people of Cape Town to the Civic Centre if De Lille failed to heed the demand.  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
