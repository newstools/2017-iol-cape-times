In a statement yesterday, Solidarity said it had met Lonmin “for the first time” to discuss the retrenchment process in terms of which the company plans to retrench 1 139 workers, including contractors. “Lonmin indicated at the outset that the retrenchments should be dealt with in a sensitive manner, but ironically and in contrast to this, the company insisted that redundant workers be retrenched before Christmas,” Solidarity said. General secretary of Solidarity Gideon du Plessis said Lonmin must sell its luxury game farm and conference centre located outside Mooinooi. “It is insensitive to retrench mineworkers who form part of Lonmin’s core business while enjoying the luxury of a game farm and accompanying modern facilities,” Du Plessis said. Lonmin management “couldn’t respond to Solidarity’s demand yesterday," he said. Du Plessis argues that during a public operational review briefing session held in August, Lonmin indicated that by September
next year the company would cut overhead costs by R500 million. “We wanted to know whether the current retrenchment process forms part of the planned R500m savings. "Lonmin’s negotiators contradicted each other and couldn’t provide a clear answer,” Du Plessis said. He added that the consultation process would only start once the parties had agreed on the issue of facilitation. Lonmin management could not be immediately reached for comment. In August, Lonmin chief executive Ben Magara revealed that platinum mines were facing serious difficulties, with 70% of the sector making losses.
