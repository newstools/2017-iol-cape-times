They have implemented changes to the logo, menu, bar area and entertainment offered. The bar area has had a revamp and now showcases a sophisticated and diverse selection of top wine and whisky brands. You can now indulge in export-quality fresh West Coast oysters, which are not sold anywhere else in SA, and try out the new menu. New items include additions to the sushi selection, main meals, and cocktail offering. They have also introduced vegan options throughout the menu. Changes are small but refined and on-going, the burst of new energy promises not to disappoint. Guests celebrated while sipping GH MUMM and gazing into their glasses at a cubic stone which could’ve meant a potential diamond win thanks to Shimansky. Carol Thorns, the electric cellist of The Bubble Live, provided entertainment and Ferrari displayed its elite fleet in the courtyard. Drinks were flowing thanks to Boschendal, Belvedere Vodka, Fleur du Cap wines, Red Bull and SAB. The kitchen served a constant flow of the menu’s best throughout the evening. Local well-known food and lifestyle bloggers Seth Shezi, Insta Eats Cape Town, Benike Palfi and Kath from Cape Town Insider were among the guests. Beluga is at The Foundry, 70 Prestwich St, Green Point, Cape Town.
