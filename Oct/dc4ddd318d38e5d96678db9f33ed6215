The 39-year-old was arrested after a fight broke out in a ward at Bellville Melomed Hospital, where Booysen was being treated after a shootout at Cape Town International Airport last Tuesday. Booysen was shot four times and a 30-year-old bystander was shot in the arm when unknown suspects opened fire in the drop-and-go section of the airport. Two days later, two men gained access to the third floor of the hospital, one dressed as a woman and the other in overalls, in what has been described as another attempt on Booysen’s life. A scuffle broke out between Booysen’s guards and the suspects and one of the men got away, but the other was arrested in a vehicle police later established had been stolen in Simon’s Town. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed the 39-year-old who was arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle would appear in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court on Monday. It is believed Booysen has been moved to another medical facility under an alias to protect both him and other patients. Security remains tight at the Bellville facility, with one police van parked near the hospital entrance and another two nearby. Two police officers in the vehicle get out frequently and stand at the entrance where a security guard, armed with a hand-held body scanner, searches all males entering the premises. At Booysen’s new location, security has been kept to a bare minimum so as to not arouse suspicion and trigger another attempt on his life. A source confirmed an order to “shoot and kill on sight” still stands for the leader of the Sexy Boys gang and that all necessary precautions were being taken to ensure that no other bystanders would be caught in the crossfire. Two other attempts were made on Booysen’s life earlier this year. There was one last month, while he was driving in his Porsche in Bellville and another in May, when he was shot twice in the neck in Ravensmead. Police have not made any arrests for the airport shooting incident. Weekend Argus
