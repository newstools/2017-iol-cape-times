Chanelle, affectionately known as Nellie, was also honoured by her peers at Edendale Primary School yesterday when a memorial was held at the Roman Catholic Church in Manenberg Avenue. There wasn’t a dry eye in the church as colleagues honoured the life of their friend whose body was found on the bank of Vygieskraal river last Friday morning after she went missing sometime on Thursday after not arriving at school. The student governing body chairperson at Edendale Primary School, Roegshanda Pascoe, said: “It was truly an emotional service. You can see there is definitely an emptiness with these pupils.” Chanelle was also honoured by her teachers who wrote a poem for her. An excerpt, written by Patricia Adams, read: “Op haar skoolwerk was sy baie trots In stille lyding, het sy gestaan soos 'n  rots Weggeruk deur die koue hand van die dood Verlang ons na haar soos 'n  stukkie brood”. “She took pride in her school work In silent suffering, she stood firm like a rock Ripped away by the cold hand of death We will miss her dearly.” Chanelle, who was in Grade 4, is said to have enjoyed spiritual dancing from a young age and in memory of this, her school friends performed a dance to one of the 10-year-old’s favourite songs. Pascoe has requested donations for Chanelle’s funeral. If you would like to donate, please call Pascoe on 071 436 1504 or Keano Smith at 071 811 5723. The two men accused of 
the rape and murder of Chanelle  appeared briefly on Wednesday
 at the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court. Carlo de Kock, who is Chanelle’s uncle, and Stanton Mano will appear in court again on November 22 for a bail application hearing.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
