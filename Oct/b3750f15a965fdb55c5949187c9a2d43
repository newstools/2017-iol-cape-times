The National Education Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) is demanding that President Jacob Zuma "immediately" release the fees commission report on the feasibility of free higher education. Nehawu said Zuma received the report in August 2017 and "nearly three months later he has not released it". In a statement released on Monday, Nehawu general secretary Zola Saphetha said: "We have all waited with bated breath for the release of the report in order to find out whether the government will be able to implement free education in the country. "Students are getting agitated and we have already seen sporadic violence in institutions like the Cape Peninsula University of Technology and the University of Free State. "We are aware that some universities have started engagements with relevant stakeholders in relation to fee increments for 2018. "This further necessitates that the president releases the report with immediate effect." Saphetha said to prevent another destructive and "time-wasting wave of #FeesMustFall protests" Zuma must release the report with immediate effect. Nehawu said it supports the South African Students Congress' "right to learn campaign and free education ... we will monitor the situation and any further delay will prompt us to compel the president to release the report as releasing it is in the best interest of the country and its future".
