Manager and co-owner Hendrik Louw said two critically endangered Bald Ibis' have died, and another two tested positive but are still alive and the park team hoped they would work through the virus.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

The provincial economic opportunities department has confirmed 56 cases of avian influenza in the Western Cape, up from 50 last week. Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde said the number of culled birds stood at 2.7 million, of which 2.6m were layer hens.
“There are just over 4.2million layer hens in the Western Cape, meaning we have lost 63% of our egg laying poultry."
There are currently 144 ostrich farms under quarantine. No ostriches have been culled.  lisa.Isaacs@inl.co.za
