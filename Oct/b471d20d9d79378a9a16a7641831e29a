The officers were reacting to shootings in Hanover Park on Saturday when criminals opened fire on them. Police spokesperson André Traut said the officers responded to shootings at Lucerne Place in Hanover Park at about 5.30pm. “On Saturday, police members reacted to shooting incidents which occurred earlier in the Hanover Park area, when they came under fire. "Three SAPS constables were wounded and admitted to hospital, where they are being treated,” Traut said. He said additional forces had been deployed to the area and a “stern approach” was being applied to stop violence in the area. In addition to the officers’ injuries, one man was killed and another injured during an earlier shooting. Traut said: “At around 3.45pm, a 30-year-old man was shot and wounded in Garda Place, Hanover Park and at 4pm a 32-year-old man was
shot and killed in Lucerne Place. "The shootings in the area are reportedly related to ongoing gang violence over drug turf.” Emergency Medical Services (EMS) confirmed that the Hanover Park area is classified as a red zone. Spokesperson Robert Daniels said: “EMS is not currently entering the area since the SAPS are not entering the area, and the SAPS provides EMS with the required escort service. The SAPS also determines when we re-enter the area.” Provincial community policing forum board spokesperson Lucinda Evans condemned the attack on the officers. “Attacks against the police cannot be the order of the day. They are there to protect us. “We wish the members a speedy recovery. They are members of family just like us (and we) apologise to their families for the pain and trauma they are enduring,” Evans said.
