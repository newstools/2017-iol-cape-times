The programme has already helped more than 10 000 children with dental problems. Founded in 2011, the Dental Wellness Trust aims at providing tailored oral health education programmes for children, the elderly and also to circulate good practice among oral health practitioners. Yesterday marked the graduation of 257 children from Mfuleni’s extension 4. Over 30 Mfuleni mothers and 160 teachers were involved in the programme, with some 750 children taking part. “Out of 20 children living in Cape Town, 14 of them have decaying teeth. In Mfuleni we have 30-40 schools involved in the programme. Children as young as four to 12 years old have been a part of the programme. “When I asked some children if their teeth are sore they almost burst into tears and that is when we decided to start the programme in 2011,” Greenwall said. Mfuleni resident Bukiwe Nxusani, 35, who is part of the programme said: “We encourage the children to brush their teeth at least three times a day. "We meet them at least three times a week through the extended programme, where we educate them and help them with school work.” Oral health promoter Ntobeko Mbambo said: “Brazil has the best oral hygiene in the world. “We are trying to push Cape Town and South Africa to become the number one oral hygiene capital of the world.” Dieketso Mpelisi, mother of Sange, 12, and Iminathi, 7, Mpelisi said she was overjoyed that her children had completed the programme. “It has helped us very much. These are the types of programmes which help to keep our kids away from the street. They are receiving their certificates today. I am very proud of them.”  lonwabo.marele@inl.co.za
