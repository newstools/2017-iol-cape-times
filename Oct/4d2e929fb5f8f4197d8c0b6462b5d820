The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) on Wednesday urged South Africans to be cautious and vigilant following recent heavy winds rainfalls. “Government will continue to endeavour doing everything possible to assist communities, but we urge everyone to be extremely vigilant, especially in the coming days and beyond amid the heavy rains still expected,” CoGTA Minister Des van Rooyen said. Severe rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms which resulted in major flash flooding in some parts of Mpumalanga,  KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Gauteng Provinces has in some areas left a tale of destruction. The rains negatively affected a number of households, both in formal and informal settlements. Bridge structures and roads have also been negatively affected causing entrapment of different vehicles along some major roads. Communities in some provinces were displaced, especially in informal areas. Five people died in KwaZulu-Natal  and five hospitals were damaged. One other person died in Gauteng as a result of the storms on Tuesday. “We convey our heartfelt condolences to those who have lost their loved ones due to the current conditions, you are in our prayers”, said Minister van Rooyen. The department said the South African Weather Service had indicated that the system that caused the inclement weather had moved to the east and most of the areas that were affected could expect predominantly sunny weather. “Due to the magnitude of the incidents, Disaster Management teams will continue to  be on alert across the country, especially in areas where more rains are expected,” said the department in a statement. “The National Disaster Management Centre is in contact with provincial and local disaster management teams on the ground to monitor the situation and give support.” – African News Agency (ANA)
