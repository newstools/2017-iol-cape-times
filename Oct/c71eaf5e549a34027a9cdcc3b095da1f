Environmental activists have slammed the Overstrand Municipality’s proposal for development in the Fernkloof Nature Reserve that would include a cableway, accommodation, restaurants, retail, an astronomy centre and 4x4 routes. In response to the municipality’s draft Integrated Management Plan to develop the reserve for various activities, a petition against the plans has so far garnered more than 3500 signatures. The Fernkloof Nature Reserve comprises 0.002% of the Cape Floral Kingdom, but contains 18% of its plants in just 18km². Experts say there is no place where as many different species grow in such close proximity. Whale Coast Conservation said the plan was “fundamentally flawed and not fit for purpose”. The public participation process associated with the plan had also been inadequate and lacked transparency and credibility, they said. “The inclusion of the proposed ‘Potential Development’ zone in the FNR, with the associated consent use and other activities listed in the draft IMP, is not consistent with the founding purpose of the FNR, or for protected areas. “The inclusion of this zone is motivated by revenue generation through activities that are not reliant upon, nor compatible with, the preservation of FNR ecosystems and biodiversity. "These developments and activities can be conducted in many places outside of the nature reserve,” the statement read. Municipal manager Coenie Groenewald and Mayco member for Infrastructure and Planning David Botha said in a joint statement this was an acclaimed nature reserve that was protected under the Protected Areas Act. Further, no rezoning application had been received. “Once comments have been received the inputs will be evaluated and in terms of the normal processes submitted to council for consideration,” they said.
