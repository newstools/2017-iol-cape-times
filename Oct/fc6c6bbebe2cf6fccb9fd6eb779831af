Heideveld residents on the Cape Flats enjoyed a special preview on Wednesday, of some of the incredible kites that will be flying at the 23rd Cape Town International Kite Festival this weekend.  Professional kiters visited the children from Cape Mental Health’s Heideveld Special Education and Care Centre, a community-based day care and education programme for 60 children with intellectual disabilities. Kiters from England,Germany, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Poland and South Africa will show that almost anything can fly - with fish, dragons, dinosaurs and even a little pig adorning the sky.      From hearts, to jellyfish and a life sized Nemo, were all on display getting little spectators excited and eager to engage. "We all have the basic right to fly – to explore our abilities, develop our skills and soar freely at home, work, school and in our community," said Ingrid Daniels, Director of Cape Mental Health.
