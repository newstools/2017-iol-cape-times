The 49-year-old, who was arrested on Sunday, appeared dishevelled at his first court appearance in the Mitchells Plain Magistrate's Court and communicated through his Legal Aid lawyer that he had been assaulted. The man, with a swollen eye, told his lawyer Naiema Herandien he had been hit in the ribs and face. Magistrate Alvira Bezuidenhout had to raise her voice for the accused to hear her after tapping his ear. The State also requested no pictures be published until after the identity parade. The accused remains in custody at Strandfontein police station until his next appearance on August 30. Family spokesperson Melanie Petersen said: “To see this guy now, it just kills me to know that he is a grown man and he would hurt a 5-year-old child. "She grew up in front of him, called him uncle. It's just devastating to see and think of the trauma they cause. "It is very traumatising for the family.” Petersen confirmed the mother was taken to hospital yesterday morning. “The grandmother was present at the court but also left before proceedings as she was not coping well,” she said. Mitchells Plain Crisis Forum chairperson Joanie Fredericks said criminals were too “calculated” in their actions. “We are * ****d off that perpetrators can come to court and say they were assaulted. He raped a 5-year-old girl and what is the comparison of the pain she went through when he committed the deed?” The little girl was able to point out to police on Sunday evening where the man lived as he is a neighbour and known to the family.
