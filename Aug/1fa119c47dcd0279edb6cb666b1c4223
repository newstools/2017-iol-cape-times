This emerged following a briefing by the provincial Department of Agriculture in the provincial Parliament's standing committee on economic opportunities, tourism and agriculture. Standing committee chairperson on economic opportunities, tourism and agriculture Beverley Schäfer said of the R67m allocated to drought relief by the provincial Department of Agriculture, R59m was used to alleviate the effects of the drought across the province. The aid included: R15m in the Central Karoo where 862 farmers, of which 314 emerging farmers, were assisted; R6m in Cederberg where 682 farmers, of which 656 emerging farmers, were assisted; and R13m in Matzikama where 1 317 farmers, of which 904 emerging farmers, were assisted. Furthermore, R5m of the remaining budget will be used to mitigate the impact of natural and biological disasters on the sector. In particular, the provincial department will use the funds to contain the outbreak of avian flu in the province, Schäfer said. “We call on all farmers in the Western Cape to be vigilant in the face of the virus,” Schäfer said. Funds will have to be provided for at least the next two years to assist drought stricken farmers, she said. Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) spokesperson Sputnik Ratau said: “Farmers are allocated water from the Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS) that is operated by DWS. These farmers are under water restriction as of 2015.
