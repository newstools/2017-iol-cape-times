Themba Ndzima, 38, alleges he was struck in the face, damaging his right eye, when he attempted to block an oncoming rush of commuters refusing to pay their train fare on Wednesday. Ndzima, who was on duty at the time of the incident, had reported to his manager that the assailant taunted him and threatened to “come back” and do it again. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said the commuter agency condemned the incident. “The incident is being investigated and we will be implementing preventive recommendations to ensure the safety of our staff. "We have also reported the matter to the SAPS to apprehend the suspect,” Scott said. Spokesperson for the United National Transport Union Sonja Carstens said: “The union is doing all we can to ensure the safety of our members. We're currently submitting an application to the Western Cape High Court, for Prasa to deploy more armed guards on the central line.” The unions’ general secretary, Steve Harris, said he was shocked by the incident, which happened just two weeks after Prasa sent armed guards to escort drivers on the central line, after several incidents of violent crime. “The harsh reality is that Prasa needs drastic security measures implemented throughout its railway network, throughout the country but cannot afford to do so,” Harris said.
