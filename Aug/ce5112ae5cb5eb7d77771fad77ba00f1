“The only reason there is peace now is because clients from leafy suburbs who buy large quantities of drugs will not come into the area while there is shooting,” said Community Policing Forum spokesperson Kader Jacobs. Jacobs said there cannot be peace in Manenberg while underlying issues of turf and the drug trade continued. “The long-term solution to peace is for them to hand in the guns and give up the drug trade,” said Kader. Community activist Rugshanda Pascoe said: “It is peace, but it's also not peace at the same time.” Pascoe said while negotiations were taking place, there was a shooting incident in another part of the area. “There cannot be peace while there are still weapons here. "Six gang members were killed in this war, three women were shot, one is paralysed and two were injured,” she said. Safety and security and Mayco member JP Smith said the City’s Metro Police Gang and Drug Task Team, K9 and Equestrian Units, Tactical Response Unit and Stabilisation Unit were deployed on extended shifts in gang hotspots, including Manenberg. Police spokesperson Novela Potelwa said police management had done a crime analysis and noted an upsurge in gang-related incidents in some parts of the Cape Flats lately and would send response teams and other interventions until the situation has stabilised.
