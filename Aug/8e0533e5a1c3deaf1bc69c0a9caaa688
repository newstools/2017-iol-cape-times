I am always perturbed when I walk along Muizenberg roads and find homeless people. Who will take care of them, and how? They are hungry, thirsty and have no bedding, especially during this winter season. If you have been perturbed and asked what you could do to help the homeless, I have tips on how we could help them. Carry your food from home or buy from the restaurant, and give it to the homeless and make them smile, even if it is for a day. Instead of throwing your old clothes away, know someone needs them on the street. Inform your friends and colleagues about the homeless people and encourage them to donate food, toiletry and clothes. Homeless people also go through emotional torture and stigmatisation. Pray for them and, if possible, have a conversation with them since everyone has a story to tell. Dennis Muriuki Muizenberg
