The Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) has observed with great interest the heightened activism in addressing gender equality by multi-sectorial organisations. Informed by its own studies on gender transformation that looked at the mining sector, institutions of higher learning and various industries, the commission believes there has been minimal progress in addressing gender transformation in the workplace. While women constitute 51% of the population in the country, they continue to remain largely oppressed and exploited. Women continue to face persistent marginalisation from power and influence. This can be attributed to a range of factors including the influences of South Africa’s colonial history and dominant patriarchal paradigms. The Commission’s Employment Equity report points to a dire situation of gender discrimination in the workplace, eg inadequate policy adherence that seek to empower women. The report has also noted an increase in reported cases of sexual harassment and rape. The Gender Commission is also cognisant that there are pay gaps between men and women, yet they are doing the same job with similar qualifications. The commission will continue to support any structure in society that has a deep interest in ensuring that gender discrimination, women empowerment and career progression of women in the workplace is addressed. The CGE appeals to industry leaders to be cognisant of women’s basic human rights such as maternity leave and provision of suitable health and safety personal protective equipment. Trade unions should continue raising women worker rights in workplaces. We also implore the private sector to strongly share good practices inter-sectorally and across economic sectors on women employment. We urge women affected by these  aspects to call our Toll-Free Number 0800 007 709 to report such cases. Javu Baloyi Commission for Gender Equality
