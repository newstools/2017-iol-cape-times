Linda Lantu, who was arrested following Jam-Jam’s disappearance on an unrelated matter, could be charged for her murder when he appeared in the Khayelitsha Magistrate's Court this morning. Jam-Jam’s bruised and bloodied body was found on July 29 after her family had last heard from her seven days earlier. On Monday, her family finally identified her body. Last night, the ANC Women’s League held a prayer at the Jam-Jams' family home in Khayelitsha. The league’s Ward 87 branch secretary,  Vuyokazi Ncinane, said Lantu was up for the attempted murder of Jam-Jam’s stepfather about three months ago. Ncinane said community members would protest outside the court and appeal that Lantu not be granted bail. “We heard from the family that when they went to identify the body today (Thursday), it was clear Aviwe was dragged and was not beaten by one person,” said Ncinane. Ilitha Labantu spokesperson Siya Monakali said it was wrong to draw attention to Jam-Jam's murder on Women’s Day, as if the  impact of the crime was somehow made worse for it. "Woman abuse should not happen at all," said Monakali. He said his organisation’s preliminary investigation found that Jam-Jam and her boyfriend’s relationship was “toxic".
