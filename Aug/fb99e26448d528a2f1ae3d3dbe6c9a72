The secret ballot for Parliament that the opposition parties have called for, to vote on a no-confidence issue in regard to President Zuma, may have interesting results. At this stage it is still not known whether the Speaker in the House will allow such a ballot or not. However, while the opposition hope that ANC members will use the opportunity of a secret ballot to vote against their leader, in the interests of both the ANC and South Africa, it would not surprise me if opposition MPs use the secret ballot to vote in favour of Zuma. The damage that Zuma has done and will do to the image of the ANC will be to the benefit of the opposition groups both now and in the 2019 national elections. Thus, to keep Zuma in power will be to the advantage of the opposition. The opposition has a most challenging vote to make. What are the chances of a secret ballot being 100% in favour or Zuma?
