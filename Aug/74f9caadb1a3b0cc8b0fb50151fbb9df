This is one of the sentiments shared on the first day of the 2017 China Trade Fair held at the Sandton Convention Centre. “China is transforming very fast. Many exhibitors from China are looking at bringing investment into the country,” said Binu Pillai, chief operating officer of MEOrient International Exhibition. “We understand that a large portion of South Africa's economy is driven by SMEs. Some manufacturers in China are looking at ways they can shift their plants this side. Joint venture and bringing investment is the focus of the show.” MEOrient International Exhibition is an organiser of the three-day expo, which started yesterday and is scheduled to run until September 2. Up to 8 000 people are expected to visit the show, popularly known as the China Homelife Fair. “We have been in the business for the last 20 years and have conducted extensive research on individual markets. We know what qualities are required in South Africa. Therefore, we have been selective in the products we bring in.” Pillai said it was the 4th edition of the China Homelife Expo in South Africa. The trade show forms part of a series of global shows that have so far taken place in Turkey, Poland, Mexico and Egypt. They are also meant to explore Africa's business partnership with Hangzhou, the capital city of China's Zhejiang province. Last year, Hangzhou’s import and export volumes are said to have reached 
$61.6 billion (R801bn),  resulting in the country becoming one of the preferred destinations for foreign investments in mainland China. The city's Gross Domestic Product per capita stands at $18.400. Jian Dang, deputy commissioner of Hangzhou’s Commission of Commerce, said hosting such expos would grow Hangzhou’s brand throughout the world.
