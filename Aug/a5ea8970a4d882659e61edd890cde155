A 16-year-old girl from Hanover Park was shot and killed in ongoing gang crossfire on Monday night. Police spokesperson Sinathi Joni confirmed that a murder case is being investigated. “A murder case has been registered at Philippi SAPS after a 16-year-old girl was fatally wounded during a shooting incident that took place in Hanover Park at 9.10pm,” Joni said. It is reported the incident happened in Athon Walk and that the girl died after one gunshot wound to her head. The girl, a Grade 9 pupil from Crystal High School, was described as a "charming girl who had gone too soon". No arrests have been made at this stage. Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated. Another rumour about a teenager being shot in his hand could not be confirmed by police, who say no such case has been reported. Ward councillor Antonio van der Rheede said he was “at wits' end” with the shootings. “Just the past weekend we held a meeting which resulted in a march to the gang leaders homes pleading with them to stop the shootings as they are killing our community. Our children can’t walk freely and we need our police to be proactive and not reactive,” he said. Cape Times
