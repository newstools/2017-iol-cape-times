ANCYL regional task team member Roscoe Jacobs, who in May was appointed as the Cape Metro co-ordinator, said there is “no record of them (ANC activists) as members”. He said the ANC activists “is a new organisation because there is no structure, league or alliance partner of the ANC which goes by such a name”. He called for the ANC leadership “to deal with those who seek to bring it into disrepute, sow divisions and tarnish the ANC’s image”. “We will not allow any such unknown rogue elements to deter us from taking the region to its regional congress in the next few weeks and we remain focused on the task at hand,” Jacobs said. Asked why a provincial ANC Youth League conference never took place though the leadership’s term ended after February 20, Jacobs said he was not sure about the decision. One of the ANC activists, Mesuli Kama, who charges that the ANCYL provincial executive was “illegitimate”, said the provincial executive committee (PEC) was not constitutional. “They are good at dismissing people that raise legitimate issues. We were expecting that they will defend the so-called PEC. I renewed my membership last September. Why was I a member of the RTT (Regional Task Team) if I was not a member?” he asked. Kama said he has proof that he is a member of the youth league. The youth league PEC was elected on February 20, said Mesuli, adding that section 6 of the league’s constitution states the term of office should be two years. Muhammad Khalid Sayed, who was elected in 2015 as the chairperson of the Youth League, directed all questions to the national youth league leadership. Asked why a conference was not called immediately after February, Sayed said “regions were not ready”.
