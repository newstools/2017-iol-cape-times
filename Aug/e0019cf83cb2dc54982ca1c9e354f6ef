Presented by Eric Abraham and written by Lee Hall, it is adapted from the Academy Award-winning (1999) screenplay by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman. It will feature 21 actors and a dog, and will be directed by resident director Greg Karvellas (The Father, Clybourne Park, Bad Jews, CHAMP). The star-studded cast includes Roxane Hayward (Blood Drive, Saints and Strangers) as Viola de Lessops; Cape Talk’s John Maytham as Fennyman; multiple award-winner Robyn Scott as Queen Elizabeth and Jason Ralph as Lord Wessex; Richard Wright-Firth (Robin Hood, Vacancy) as Robin; Bianca Flanders as Mistress Quickly; Theo Landey (The Play That Goes Wrong; The History Boys) as Marlowe; Nicholas Pauling (The Father, A Steady Rain, Clybourne Park) as Ned Allen; Sven Ruygrok (The Mother, Epstein, Spud) as Sam and Mark Elderkin (Twelfth Night, Champ) as Burbage; and Louis Viljoen (The Play That Goes Wrong, The Frontiersmen) as Mr Wabash. In the play, a youthful Will Shakespeare has writer’s block and the deadline for his new play is fast approaching but he is in desperate need of inspiration. That is, until he finds his muse - Viola. This beautiful young woman is Will’s greatest admirer and will stop at nothing (including breaking the law) to appear in his next play. Against a background of mistaken identity and ruthless scheming, Will’s love for Viola quickly blossoms and inspires him to write his greatest masterpiece. The set design is by Paul Wills, with costume design by Birrie le Roux. *  Tickets cost from R130 to R320; bookings at the Fugard Theatre box office at 021 461 4554.
