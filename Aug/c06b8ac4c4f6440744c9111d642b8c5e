The incident on Monday occurred during a fight between the two pupils. Western Cape Education Department spokesperson Millicent Merton said: “We can confirm the incident at Kuils River Technical High School. "Two boys were involved in a fight. One of the boys stabbed the other and the injured learner was treated at the day hospital. He was discharged after his wound was stitched up.” On the same day, police opened a common assault case after a pupil from the same school allegedly assaulted a teacher. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the alleged assault occurred after the pupil had handed over a script. “While the teacher read through the answers, the learner tried to grab it out of the teacher’s hand. The learner assaulted the teacher with her bare hands,” Van Wyk said. The two incidents came a week after a Soneike High School pupil was allegedly assaulted by a fellow pupil last week. “The complainant was at a high school at Highbury Road, Highbury. While waiting for school to start, the complainant was standing outside the classroom, when a fellow pupil (a girl) also turned up for school. "The complainant greeted her with a hug, and she smacked the complainant in his face and kicked him on his leg,” Van Wyk said. A case of common assault was opened for this incident at the Kuils River police station. Cape Times
