She is now a relief worker and resident at the centre. Speaking to the Cape Times at the centre’s open day yesterday, she said at her lowest point she could not bring herself to look at her reflection in the mirror. “I gave myself completely over to drugs because I was abused by my mother, brother and boyfriend at the time. The day I came here (a year ago), I believe it was meant to be because they told me they had a place available and they took me in,” said Kleinhans. Living in the centre with her seven-year-old daughter, Ranicke, Kleinhans said the centre had given her the strength to face herself and the world, and even build a relationship with her estranged father. Kleinhans now plans to become a counsellor or social worker, as she wants to help other women, as well as her alcoholic brother. Residential manager Dorothea Gertse said that through the various programmes on offer at the centre, women like Kleinhans are able to rebuild their lives. “Anicke started working as a kitchen and chef’s assistant and then showed the aptitude and work ethic to become a relief worker. "That’s what we hope to instil in all our clients, but in the end it is their lives and that of their children which motivates their success,” said Gertse. Centre manager Shaheema McLeod said that while celebrating women for their achievements this month, gender-based violence should also be highlighted. “We are fighting a war; there are daily casualties and long-lasting trauma. ‘‘Women need to know where to seek help when they are being threatened and victimised,” said McLeod.
