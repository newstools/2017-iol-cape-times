“I am very thankful for this opportunity. This is a dream that came true. I always wanted to do this, but I never had the opportunity. I am so thankful for this,” Engels said. The course costs R24 000. Angela Botha from Kommetjie acted as a link between the beauty school’s principal, Shirley Wenman, and AfriForum, in reaching Engels to make the offer. Wenman yesterday said she was thrilled that they would have Engels on board: “We are so excited to be having her next year. We will be taking good care of her." Botha said she was happy they were able to make a positive contribution, as “this can really change her life". The young model, Engels, then 20, was assaulted by Zimbabwean First Lady Grace Mugabe while Engels was visiting the first lady’s two sons, Robert jn and Chatunga Bellarmine Mugabe at an upmarket hotel in Sandton about two weeks ago. Mugabe used an extension cord to assault Engels and her two friends while the two sons and Mugabe’s bodyguards stood by and watched. “Gabriella was totally overwhelmed, in tears, when her trauma counsellor conveyed the news to her. She couldn’t believe her dream was coming true,” Willie Spies, AfriForum’s legal representative, said yesterday. The civil rights organisation is representing Engels in her legal battle against Mugabe. On September 19, an application to overturn a decision to grant Mugabe diplomatic immunity is expected to be heard in the North Gauteng High Court. AfriForum said Minister of International Relations and Co-operation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane had misinterpreted Section 7(2) of the Diplomatic Immunity and Privileges Act and did not have the power to grant immunity to Grace Mugabe.
