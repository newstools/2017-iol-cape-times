Johannesburg - A horrifying video of a couple's assault reportedly at a KFC drive-through in Montana has sparked outrage on social media. The six alleged attackers can be heard swearing at a man identified on social media as Jacob Sono and his wife. Sono's wife then asks her alleged attackers several times "Are you going to hit me?" According to reports, four of the alleged attackers have been arrested, while the other two are still at large. WARNING GRAPHIC VIDEO     Twitter users were outraged once the video went viral on the social media site. Several people reached out to Minister of Police Fikile Mbulala to help find the alleged attackers, and Mbalula replied saying that he would contact the SAPS and also asked that more information be sent to him via a direct message.  I've notified SAPS to attend to this with urgency. Sinoville Police are looking into it. https://t.co/ZntKL66Niz â€” RSA Police Minister (@MbalulaFikile) August 4, 2017   IOL
