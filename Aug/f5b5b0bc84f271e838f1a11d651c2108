When doctors diagnosed Tyrell Arendse, 7, his family were told that he would only live until the age of eight. “He went peacefully in my, his grandma and his father’s arms. “It was not easy watching him take his last breath, but he had pneumonia and he was really suffering. “We had been praying for God to relieve him and now his suffering is over,” said his mother Jade Arendse. Batten disease is an inherited condition, usually characterised by fits, blindness and deteriorating mental and physical development. “Our angel has gained his wings and is with Jesus. We love you, Tyrell Jaden Arendse, you are free to soar with the angels.” Only one in every 200 000 people carry the gene for Batten disease and Tyrell was one of two children in South Africa suffering from it. “It is very sad for us as a family, but we knew this day was coming.” She explained that her son was born a normal baby until he reached the age of three. In stages, his health deteriorated. It first started with seizures, then he went blind and lost his ability to talk. In the last two years of his life he was bedridden. "But despite his battles, his mother said her son fought a strong fight. “He fought a hard fight and touched many lives. He had a beautiful smile and that’s what  I will miss the most about him.” The family are reaching out for donations to help with his funeral, which is set to take place on Saturday.
