The NFP, which is coalition with the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal, will make a final decision today, according to caucus 
secretary Munzoor Shaik-Emam. “The difficulty we have is that there is a great danger that the country will be destabilised by one decision,” Shaik-Emam said. He said it did not matter whether there was a secret or open ballot. “At the end of the day, the outcome will depend how the ANC votes, so whatever we do does not matter.” This comes against a backdrop of reports that the NFP caucus, consisting of four MPs, was sharply divided on how to vote. The reports have suggested that some of public representatives, including party leader Zanele Magwaza-Msibi, were opposed to the motion while others, especially those who are fighting their expulsion, wanted the party to vote Zuma out. The  African Independent Congress (AIC)  said yesterday the ANC should not expect favours from the party when it comes to the vote. The two parties recently signed an agreement in which they agreed the Matatiele Municipality would be shifted to KwaZulu-Natal, as part of a deal that ensured the ANC clung to power in the Ekurhuleni metro in Gauteng. AIC secretary-general Mahlubandile Jafta said they had made it clear before when we asked the president to step down. "We pleaded with him to resign." Meanwhile, the PAC is embroiled in a fight on the ballot to be cast by its sole MP, Luthando Mbinda, who was expelled by a faction in his party after allegedly 
absconding from a disciplinary hearing. The PAC has been attempting to have Mbinda replaced as an MP on the grounds that he was no longer their member and deems the casting of ballot by Mbinda as unconstitutional. Yesterday, Mbinda said he had not been dismissed and that he would abstain from voting.
