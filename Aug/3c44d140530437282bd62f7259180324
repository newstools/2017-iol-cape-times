Children got a chance to learn to fix and recycle things like toasters or irons in a safe environment. Not only were they at close quarters with the internal components of appliances, but they also built their own gadgets and imaginary creations to take home. The event took place yesterday  at the City Hall in three scheduled sessions of two hours each. The Open Design Cape Town Festival explores how creative approaches to problem solving and sustainable design can benefit South Africa.
