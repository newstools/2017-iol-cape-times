Her parents told the Cape Times yesterday they were satisfied police have told them blood stains found in one of Ntula’s cars were sent to the police’s forensic laboratory for testing. Jam Jam’s stepfather Mike Mguga said some of Ntula's clothing, found at Ntula's house during a search, also contained blood stains. Khayelitsha Police Cluster commander Johan Brand told mourners at the memorial service that because Jam Jam’s murder case was opened in Athlone and Mguga’s in Khayelitsha, they would be "centralised at the provincial office". Police spokesperson Frederick van Wyk played down Brand’s comments and said there was nothing linking the murder of Jam Jam and the attempted murder of her stepfather. With regards to an arrest in Jam Jam’s case, Van Wyk said there were “no new developments to report, investigations continue”. Shortly after the memorial service on Wednesday, Mguga told Cape Times the family was happy “there are some things that link him (Ntula)” to Aviwe’s murder. “We are liaising with the investigating officers and we are happy with the progress thus far. The blood stains from his clothing are at the laboratory,” said Mguga. Jam Jam’s body was found at Vygieskraal Stadium in Athlone on July 29, a week after she was reported missing. Her family say she was in an abusive relationship with Ntula with whom she had a two-year-old son. He will spend a month behind bars until his next court appearance on September 8.
