The tournament, hosted by Cape Town-based kung fu champion Muhammad MJ Li Chafeker, will involve 55 pupils from seven schools across the province. This Saturday, the Rocklands School Hall will see young people competing in group, form and weapon demonstrations, as well as full contact, for a chance to be crowned a champion. Chafeker has brought home the gold three times, representing South Africa in the annual international Legends of Kung Fu Championships in Dallas, Texas. Gang Dong of the South African Chinese Cultural Development Centre expressed great excitement to promote Chinese culture to the youth. Dong is also the head of the local Hua Xing arts group. “It is going to be something interesting and different for them. "Dragon Dance is a normal part of any celebration we do. So this is a great opportunity to integrate the Chinese community with locals because we are also part of the community,” said Dong. Dong said they would be collaborating with Chafeker in future to send a coach to teach students the art of dragon dance. Dong said he had also invited the Chinese consulate in Cape Town and local community leaders in the Chinese community to support the event. Chafeker said: “I consider it a massive honour that my efforts to introduce Chinese culture through kung fu are appreciated. "I think I am more excited than the students, it has been a long journey and the kids have been training hard since the beginning of this year.” “This has never happened before. I would like everyone to come and see how we develop future kung fu champions.” The event will start  from 9.30am untill about 3pm and tickets cost R25 at the door.
