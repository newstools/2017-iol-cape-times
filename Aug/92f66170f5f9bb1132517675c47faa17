It is with shock and dismay that the ANC in the Western Cape has learnt of an attempted armed robbery incident involving the MEC for Social Development in the Western Cape, Albert Fritz, and an official in his office. According to preliminary reports, the MEC and the official arrived at a venue in Nyanga when two armed men approached them and robbed both of their cellphones. The MEC’s protectors intervened and when one noticed that one of the robbers had a firearm, he responded,  in the process fatally wounding one of the robbers. “When looking at the Western Cape’s crime statistics over the past eight years, one would note that violent crime has increased on average annually at an alarming rate. “Today we see again that these criminals, who continue to torture our communities, do not discriminate,” said Faiez Jacobs, provincial secretary of the ANC in the Western Cape. “We all need to work together to create a safer and more secure Western Cape for all and even this callous attack on one of the most hard-working MECs should serve as a wake-up call to all,” he concluded. The ANC wishes the MEC and the official strength as they recuperate from this horrific ordeal. Lionel Adendorf Convener: PEC Sub-committee on Media and Communications
