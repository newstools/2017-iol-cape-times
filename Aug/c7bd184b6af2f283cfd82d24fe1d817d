The father of murdered Valhalla Park teenager Lekita Moore, 18, is frustrated at how long it has taken for the trial to reach its conclusion. Moore’s mutilated and naked body was found on a field in Valhalla Park after she had been raped and murdered in September last year. She had been stabbed several times in the throat and stomach. Her father, Charles Moore, said: “I feel the case must finish now. I am sick and tired of seeing his face. I want the judge to punish him.” Moore was referring to Cameron Wilson, 20, who in June was convicted for the murder of Lekita as well as 12 other counts of murder, attempted murder, rape, assault and illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. After arguments were heard for mitigation and aggravation of sentence in the Western Cape High Court yesterday, Judge Chantal Fortuin confirmed she would sentence Wilson on Thursday. Yesterday, prosecutor Carine Teunissen argued that Wilson had shown no remorse throughout the trial and should be considered a danger to society. Wilson's lawyer, Mohamed Sibda, argued that his client was young, had no previous convictions and that there was an absence of premeditation. He asked that Wilson’s sentences run concurrently and not be declared a danger to society. The prescribed sentence for Lekita’s murder was 15 years. For most of the other counts, minimum mandatory sentencing was prescribed, ranging from 15 years to life. Moore said seeing Wilson in court made him “want to kill him because he thinks nothing of other people’s life”. “She was the apple of my eye, many times I still cry over my daughter. "Only the day when God comes to fetch me is the day the pain will go away,” said Moore.  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
