Cape Town - The DA said that the result of the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma reveals that "the ANC is totally divided against itself". "Tonight's result, despite the slender victory, signals the death of the ANC. "The brave ANC members that voted to defend our democracy today should realise that their home no longer resides in the ANC but in becoming part of the movement for the new beginning. "Today's result is not a cause for despair. It should serve as motivation to South Africans to organise, get involved and help build a new government in 2019. That is the only way we can achieve the new beginning we need!" The official opposition party also warned that this motion is "not the end of the road for the president, as he still has 783 charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering to answer for and we will see him in the Supreme Court of Appeal."
