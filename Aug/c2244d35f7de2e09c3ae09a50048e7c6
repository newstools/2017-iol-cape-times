Thank you for the love and kindness that you have shared with us. Thank you for protecting us. You have gone through violence and struggle for us and, for that, we would love to give a big thank you to all the women for not giving up. As young girls, we are following in your footsteps, the footsteps of being women is to never give up. Women speak up against the ills of our society and protect those they love at all times. I did not understand the word WOMEN at first but, as time went by, I met other girls and women. It was after these engagements that I realised the important role women play in society. Through all of that, I still had to learn that life as a young girl will take you from one lesson to the other. You will make mistakes and learn from them no matter how big or small; but still, as women, nothing is too big or small for you. And as life goes on you will meet different people. Some of them will want to destroy you, while others will build you up. I am thankful to all the women who cared, loved me and wanted what's best for me. Not only those women who helped me understand what it means to be a woman, but also those brave women who marched against the vicious apartheid government to fight for our rights on August 9, 1956. The crowd of about 
20 000 women proved to the world that women are courageous and brave. They chanted the famous slogan “Wathint ’abafazi Wathinta imbokodo” (You strike a woman you strike a rock) to show their  braveness and strength. To those women who took our suffering away, we are grateful for their actions. They did not only teach but proved that a woman is powerful, strong and beautiful. As a young girl, I have joined the Rock Girls - a group of powerful and brave girls fighting for the rights of young girls in order to be their voice. As this Women's Month comes to an end, we and our two brave mothers, Inda Baird and Phiwe, say thank you to all the women who continue to be the rock of their families and societies.
