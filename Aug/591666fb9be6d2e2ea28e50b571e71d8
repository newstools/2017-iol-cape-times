JOHANNESBURG - South African Revenue Service CFO Matsobane Matlwa has resigned, spokesman Sandile Memela confirmed on Friday. According to speculative reports, Matlwa's resignation comes after the executive was handed a suspension letter, however the tax service said it would not comment on the reasons behind his stepping away from the group.
 
SARS said in a statement that its group executive for procurement, Johnston Makhubu, would serve as the acting CFO.
 
SARS this week made headlines after reports pointed to the questionable travel behaviour of its commissioner, Tom Moyane, who was reportedly in Dubai at the same time as many others implicated in the the Gupta network. Also read: SARS boss says he never met with the Guptas
 
It was confirmed that Moyane was travelling via Dubai in December 2015, around the same time as the Gupta brothers‚ President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane, former Eskom CFO Anoj Sing‚ former PA to public enterprises minister Lynne Brown, Kim Davids‚ and two sons of Free State premier Ace Magushule.
 
All these individuals have been tied to the Gupta network via the Gupta leak emails, and it raised eyebrows among analysts and commentators that all were in the same place at the same time.
 
However, Moyane has denied ever meeting the Guptas in his personal or private capacity, and says the insinuation that he was linked to them or their network was “malicious and reckless in the extreme”. - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
