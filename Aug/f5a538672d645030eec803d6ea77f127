The mooted commission of inquiry into state capture should be established immediately before any public funds ''are further spirited away to Dubai'', the SACP said on Sunday. ''We are concerned that everybody agrees about the commission, including the the President [Jacob Zuma]; it is one of the thing we will have to discuss with the ANC as to how far the establishment of the judicial commission is... "We cannot be talking about a commission forever and there is no movement on the issue,'' SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande told reporters in Johannesburg following the party's central committee meeting. Law enforcement agencies should take action in view of the leaked Gupta emails detailing the extent of the controversial family's influence in state affairs and public entreprises. ''Where there are clear-cut, prima facie cases of wrongdoing, the criminal justice institutions must move with urgency and determination, without which more billions of rand of public money will continue be spirited out of our country to Dubai and other off-shore locations,'' Nzimande said. He added that both the judicial commission and Parliamentâ€™s portfolio committee on public enterprises' state capture probe were important and should go ahead separately as planned.
