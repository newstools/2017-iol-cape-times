The Western Cape province experienced some much needed rains last week, but according to the latest dam levels report released by the Department of Water and Sanitation, they did not make much impact as water levels in the province improved slightly. According to the dam levels assessment of August 7, the combined average dam levels for the Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS) are at 28.96% as compared to 27.49 % last week. The Theewaterskloof Dam has increased by over 1% and is at 22.41% as compared to 21.27% last week. There is also a noticeable increase in the Clanwilliam Dam as it has recorded 28.63% as compared to 27.28% last week. We are pleased with the frequency of rainfalls, however not ecstatic on the slow rate of replenishment of the damsâ€™ bulk storage and hence we would like to urge all water users to keep using less water until significant rainfall in the catchments. Water must only be used for essential services. Malusi Rayi Communications: Department of Water and Sanitation Western Cape
