Fear of contracting deadly diphtheria has prompted the community of Nomzamo in Strand to instruct their children to stay indoors and not interact with their neighbours, following the death of a 10-year-old girl in the area. Visiting friends was prohibited in some homes, and the Cape Times has learnt that this will be the case until the provincial health department ensures the outbreak is under control. Keet Blou, 10, died on August 4 of the highly contagious bacterial disease, and three of her family members were infected. The girl tested positive for diphtheria a day before her death. Zimkhitha Mquteni, spokesperson for Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo, said two siblings and the girl’s mother tested positive for the disease after the department followed up with close relatives in an effort to contain the disease. The family and more than 600 community members have been provided with post-exposure medication, said Mquteni. Nolusapho Daweti, who lives in the vicinity of  Blou’s family, said nurses had advised them to keep their children indoors at all times and not interact with people. “This disease needs special attention because it is so easy to catch it," said Daweti. "The children understand that they cannot interact with outsiders until this has calmed. Our health comes first." Another neighbour, Nkosiphendule Mlungwana, said should the disease be out of control, many people risked losing their lives. “It is easy to pass it to another person and t6he other person to a third person,” he said. Mquteni said as another proactive measure in containing the spread of cases, the department had embarked on a vaccination campaign for children under the age of 15 living in Nomzamo. “We encourage parents and caregivers to ensure their children’s immunisation status is up to date, and if unsure they should visit their nearest clinic,” she said.
