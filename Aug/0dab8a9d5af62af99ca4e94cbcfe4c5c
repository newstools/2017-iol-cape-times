The African Choir 1891 Re-imagined is an art exhibition presented by Tshisa Boys Productions done by composers Philip Miller and Thuthuka Sibisi in partnership with Autograph ABP and curator Ren√©e Mussai. The exhibition was launched in Cape Town at two locations before it will move to Johannesburg to the Apartheid Museum and the FADA Gallery, where it will hosted by the Visual Identities in Art and Design Research Centre (VIAD) at the University of Johannesburg. Alongside the exhibition will be a series of panel discussions with presentations by the creators, which comprise five songs re-created by the composers from an original 19th century concert programme. The exhibition is currently on display at the Iziko South African National Gallery until November 13. A digital version of the exhibition is screened daily at the Cape Town Civic Centre concourse (adjacent to the public food court) until Friday between 8am and 5pm. Included are 20 photographic portraits of the original members of the choir re-discovered in London at the Hulton Archive after 125 years.  lonwabo.marele@inl.co.za
