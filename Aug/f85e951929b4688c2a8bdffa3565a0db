Cape Town -  South African hostage Stephen McGown, kidnapped in Mali in 2011, has been released and is back home, Minister of International Relations and Co-operation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane announced on Thursday. No ransom was paid to secure the July 29 release of McGowan, who was undergoing medical checks, Nkoana-Mashabane told a news conference. McGown was taken hostage in Mali in November 2011, along with Swedish national Johan Gustafsson and Hollander Sjaak Rijke, a Dutch citizen. The trio were snatched from a restaurant in Timbuktu along with a German friend, who was killed immediately by the militants. McGown had worked for Investec in the UK, and was on his “final adventure” biking through Africa, before returning to South Africa. SA NGO Gift of the Givers has been trying to negotiate McGown freedom over the years. His heartbroken mother died in May without being reunited with her son. IOL and Reuters
