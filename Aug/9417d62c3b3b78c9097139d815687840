The EFF will not entertain the motion of the DA to dissolve Parliament because it is disingenuous. If the DA truly wants Parliament to be dissolved, all the party needs to do is to resign all its members, as well as the party from Parliament in line with section 46 (1) of the constitution which states that the “National Assembly consists of no fewer than 350 and no more than 400 members”. Once the DA, which has 89 members, resigns, Parliament would not meet the constitutional requirement as per section 46 and thus would dissolve. The EFF already approached the DA to implement this earlier in the year and the DA outrightly rejected it. The EFF did this following the outcome of the Constitutional Court judgment on Nkandla which found Parliament failed to execute its duties in holding Zuma accountable. This judgement implied that the fifth Democratic Parliament is illegitimate. On this  basis the EFF approached the DA that Parliament must be dissolved through Section 46 and the DA refused. We therefore call on the DA, if it is genuine and means business, to stop wasting Parliament’s time and simply withdraw from the body as it will meet the party’s required objective.
