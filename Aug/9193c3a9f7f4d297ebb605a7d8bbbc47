The faith-based organisation distributed winter jackets, beanies and scarves to the more than 1200 pupils as part of its Operation Winter Warmth campaign. The head of distribution, Shafiek Barendse, said the campaign aimed to help those from the impoverished communities. “Our field workers went out to find schools that we could assist and, unfortunately, there are so many we wish we could assist, but we are unable to. "We selected Sigcawu Primary because of the need here, as their principal told us many of their pupils don’t even have a winter jacket to wear,” said Barendse. He said the organisation made sure the clothing items were in the school colours, and also gave the children and teachers a warm hearty meal and, to add to the day, a treat with a party pack. Barendse urged the public to help by donating R250 for a jacket and beanie, or R150 for a blanket. Principal Ntobeko Mlumbi said: “Our pupils come predominantly from Crossroads and we are so happy and excited our school was chosen by Sanzaf. Many of our pupils come from single-parent homes or are being raised by their grandmothers who rely on social grants. Mlumbi said attending school in the cold without a jacket was a reality for many pupils, and it was evident on their faces yesterday that they appreciated the gift.
