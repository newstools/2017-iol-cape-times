The show will see culinary students compete against each other in a mystery box cooking challenge. The ultimate winner will go home with R150 000 in prizes and a job opportunity to make their career dreams a reality. Riffel said being given the opportunity to host such a competition was a privilege but he had to restrain himself from helping the contestants during the cook-offs. “I enjoy working with students and youngsters, but sometimes I want to jump in and help with the cooking,” he said. “Each contestant has 70 minutes to produce one dish as well as pair a wine in the mystery basket challenge. There is ostrich, seafood, topside and some interesting vegetables in the boxes. “The prominent South African guest judge is the only one that they have to impress to get a chance to work in their kitchens. It’s exciting to watch and very pressurising for the contestants.” Students are not only judged on the presentation and taste of their dishes, but also on their
passion, attitude, skills, creativity, completion of the challenge, wine selection, work ethics and culinary knowledge. In each of these categories they receive a point out of 10 and the student with the highest score out of 100 goes through to the finals. Unfortunately, if they don’t
make the cut, they go home empty-handed. *  Viewers also stand a chance to win prizes to the value of R350 000 by preparing their favourite dish and uploading a photo of themselves with their dish to Instagram with the hashtag #IsDitProfessioneel and tag @SamsungSA as well as @Proefessioneel. Proefessioneel airs on SABC2 on Wednesdays at 7pm.
