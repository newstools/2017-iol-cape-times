During that meeting, they allegedly said: “We will close this door” and “die poppe sal dans (the dolls will dance)”. This was contained in a complainant form submitted to the university's judicial affairs office by acting vice-chancellor Chris Nhlapo. Pan African Student Movement (Pasma) leaders Ayakha Magxotwa, Sivuyise Nolusu, Lukhaby Vangqa and EFF student leader Neo Mongale were suspended from all university premises and its residences. They face charges of contravening five codes of conduct within the academic and student rules and regulations. It's alleged the students stormed the meeting with about 50 others, surrounding council members. Vangqa said the frustration came after management were “dragging their feet” in resolving the issue of a shortage of residences at the Cape Town campus. “The acting vice-chancellor delegated the HoD to follow-up our concerns and come back to us, but he never did, said Vangqa. “I was in the admin building and saw what was happening. I then went to the meeting to calm things down because the situation was tense and chaotic. "After I suggested that a former acting vice-chancellor who students trust mediate the situation, the council members left.” In the complaint from Nhlapo, he said students wanted to be placed in residence, but the private residence the university had to procure had legal issues with CPUT. He had also said that of the names submitted for residence, some of the students did not meet the requirements. According to Nhlapo, after students were informed of this, they disrupted the meeting. A  protest erupted at the CPUT Cape Town campus yesterday following the suspension.  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
