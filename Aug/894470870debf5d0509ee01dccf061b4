Jack, who used a wheelchair, had daily seizures and no control over muscle spasms, leaving him severely disabled, mentally and physically. He died on February 28. Despite his death, Zip Zap has confirmed it will still host a fund-raiser, scheduled for September 9. Phoebe was diagnosed with infantile spasms, then Ohtahara syndrome and later Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Her muscles are not spastic but quite flexible, and she has muscle strength in both her arms and her legs. The wheelchair buggy Phoebe  uses was donated by Red Cross Memorial Children’s Hospital. Phoebe’s mother Bronwin Lotteriet said Phoebe cannot sit properly, stand or walk and is not talking. Her brain is not sending messages to the body to respond. She needs funds for exorbitant medical treatment costs and equipment to move her around. Lotteriet said Phoebe “has a beautiful personality that only comes out with patience, touch and love”. “When she hears her name and her mother’s voice, her personality comes out. Her need for one-on-one attention and stimulation are great.” Lotteriet said she was grateful to Jack’s mother, Taryn Bain, for deciding to bless Phoebe with some of the funds from the concert. She hopes the concert will raise enough money to get Phoebe a stroller that will accommodate her orthopaedic needs and be transportable, so Phoebe can go outdoors often. Tickets, at R100, can be bought from Ann Barr on 0824513696 or by e-mailing anncbarr@gmail.com, or at the Zip Zap Circus Dome.
