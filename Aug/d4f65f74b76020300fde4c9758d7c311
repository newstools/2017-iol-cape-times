Nicole Maasdorp, 28, from Lentegeur says instead of helping her, management at Debonairs Pizza in Promenade Mall ignored her. “I am disappointed in their service. On Wednesday 26 July, I placed a delivery and patiently awaited my order. Firstly, I was going to pay with my card and [the delivery guy] told me he had a problem with the card machine and asked for a charger,” she explains. “I allowed him into our kitchen and my phone, a Samsung A5, was lying steps away. I turned my back for a second to try and charge his machine, it did not work so I paid cash. “After I paid, he was in a hurry to leave. It was only the two of us in that part of the house; my family were in their rooms. After he left, I realised my phone was gone.” She called him back and asked him about her phone, but he denied taking it. “When I called him back, he was busy with something by his scooter. When he came in again, I called my phone and it was suddenly off,” she says. She has since laid a charge of theft against the delivery man. Captain FC van Wyk, says: “This office can confirm that the matter is still under investigation. No arrests yet.” An angry Nicole says management at the Promenade Mall branch is ignoring her. “I bought from them every week, but they’ve lost me as a customer. I spoke to the operations manager and he just kept giving me the runaround. I never got any feedback whatsoever up until today,” Nicole adds. Toni Goubert, the Marketing Executive of Debonairs, says the matter is being investigated. “We take these type of complaints very seriously and we want to make sure we get to the bottom of this so a thorough investigation will take place,” says Goubert. “We want to ensure that this doesn’t ever happen again. Customers can also contact our Customer Care line should they not receive a response from the direct store management. Customer care queries come directly to top management.” Daily Voice
