With Springbok captain Warren Whiteley injured, lock Eben Etzebeth will lead the Springboks in his absence for their 2017 Rugby Championship campaign. The Springboks will kick off their Rugby Championship proceedings against Argentina in Port Elizabeth on August 19, before travelling to Argentina a week later for the return leg in Salta. Regular Lions skipper Whiteley, who was appointed Bok captain for the 2017 season earlier this year, is expected to be out for at least six more weeks with a groin injury. Etzebeth, who made his international debut against England in Durban as a 20-year-old back in 2012, has played 57 Test matches for the Springboks. The lock will also have a quality vice captain in Stormers skipper Siya Kolisi, while Bok coach Allister Coetzee mentioned experienced Sharks prop Tendai Mtawarira and Lions flyhalf Elton Jantjies as being part of a “strong leadership group”. Coetzee also praised Etzebeth for the way he stood in for Whiteley during the final Test against the French. “Eben did an excellent job against France in Johannesburg, when he had to step in at short notice after the late withdrawal of Warren. He enjoys the respect of his teammates and also commands respect on and off the field,” said Coetzee. “He is well supported by our strong leadership group which consists of Siya, Tendai Mtawarira and Elton Jantjies.”
