Cape Town - Black First Land First members were on Thursday denied access to a media event hosted by the Daily Maverick in Cape Town. The organisation, led by Andile Mngxitama, reportedly tried to gain access to the Daily Maverick's "The Gathering" event, currently underway at the Cape Town International Convention Centre. In a series of videos posted on Twitter, Mngxitama and his colleagues are seen trying to get into the venue, claiming they had tickets, but are being denied entry by security personnel. The group then proceeds to hurl insults at security members, before demanding their money back for the tickets purchased. This is not the first time the lobby group has caused a disruption at a media event, having recently interrupted a media event hosted by amaBhungane in Braamfontein. The South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) was also granted an interdict against the group and Mngxitama, after they intimidated and harassed numerous media personalities. The interdict barred BLF and Mngxitama from engaging in any of the following acts directed towards the applicants: intimidation; harassment; assaults; threats; going to their homes or acting in any manner that would constitute an infringement of their personal liberty.
