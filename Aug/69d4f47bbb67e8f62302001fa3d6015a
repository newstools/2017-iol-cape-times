UWC has launched a fund-raising initiative to prevent students from quitting their studies, simply because they cannot keep up with the financial demands. Its Access to Success campaign, aims to help students like 25-year old, Zandile Gqada, a BCom student majoring in information systems at  UWC. A determined woman, Gqada who is currently living with her mother and her three-year-old son in Khayelitsha, has faced her share of challenges. After her greatest supporter, her father, died, she ended up failing her studies and falling pregnant. She even considered committing suicide. “I took courage because I needed to finish my studies, so I can improve my circumstances,” she said. Gqada said she knows success is not guaranteed, but hard work will make the difference. “Access to money was and still is a challenge for me, as it is hard sometimes to come to campus because my mother is a pensioner and has to spend her resources on essentials like transport, to help with my studies. “I still have R33 000 of study debt left, which I hope to settle within the next few years. “The Access to Success campaign has made a real and significant difference in my life. I have already received R9 000 through NSFAS.” Access To Success started last year, where more than R1 million was raised in the phonathon linked to the campaign. This year, the phonathon started last week and will run until the end of the month. UWC Alumni Office manager Samantha Castle said to date 93 students had benefited and currently students apply for this funding through their financial aid office.
