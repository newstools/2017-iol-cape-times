Cape Town - This week the ANC’s national audit and verification team will descend on the Western Cape to audit and verify the party’s membership in all six regions of the province. The outcome of the audit will determine how many delegates the Western Cape ultimately sends to December’s elective conference, where ANC members will elect a new leadership. ANC Western Cape secretary Faiez Jacobs said each region would be given a chance to come to the party’s provincial office, where they would bring the “branch file”, which is a list of members in each of the branches. Last month, the ANC’s Dullah Omar region was disbanded by the party’s provincial executive, ostensibly over gate-keeping and manipulation of branch membership that would determine delegates to December’s conference. The disbandment was reversed by the national working committee. Earlier this year, the ANC’s provincial executive, in a statement, called on President Jacob Zuma to step down over his numerous controversies, while leaders in the Dullah Omar region, the largest of the ANC’s six in the Western Cape, actively supported Zuma and Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma to succeed him. Now regional leaders will have to prove their membership claims and that these are fully paid up with a bank deposit slip. “The process should last no more than two weeks. There will be an opportunity for disputes before BGMs (branch general meetings) take place,” said Jacobs. He said that after the verification process, each branch would have a list of its membership, and those who wanted to dispute this would be free to do so. In July, ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize confirmed the ANC was investigating membership fraud in four provinces – KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Limpopo and Mpumalanga. In KZN, there are believed to be as many as 200 000 “ghost” members. Cape Times
