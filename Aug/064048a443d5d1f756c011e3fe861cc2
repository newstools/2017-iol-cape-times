President Jacob Zuma's outspoken son, Edward Zuma, has reportedly apologised for derogatory remarks he made about fellow ANC members Pravin Gordhan and Derek Hanekom in an open letter published earlier this week. 
 
The KwaZulu-Natal ANC confirmed on Thursday that it had received an apology from Zuma after it threatened to haul him before a disciplinary hearing.

Zuma had penned a letter last week which criticised Gordhan calling him an "apologist for white monopoly capital" and with Hanekom being described as an "Afrikaner askari". 
 
He was adamant for some time that he was not wrong and refused to apologise. It's not known what prompted his sudden change of tune. 
 
The ANC in KZN had faced pressure to charge Zuma, especially following the province's decision to charge MP Makhosi Khoza for her remarks against President Zuma, calling for him to resign. 
 
Khoza's disciplinary hearing will take place in September. Politics Hub
