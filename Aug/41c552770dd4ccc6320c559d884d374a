Parliamentarians want action to be taken against people mentioned in a report by the institution’s legal services for misleading the SABC ad hoc committee. This comes after the report was discussed yesterday by the communications committee after an initial delay following a decision by Speaker Baleka Mbete to ask those named to make written submissions. The SABC ad hoc committee had recommended that the inquiry’s evidence leader identify witnesses who had allegedly given misleading testimonies and that criminal charges be laid against them. Public Service Administration Minister Faith Muthambi is one of the people named, along with former board chairpersons Mbulaheni Maguvhe and Dr Ben Ngubane, former company secretary Theresa Geldenhuys and former CFO James Aguma. All were given an opportunity to respond, but only four submitted responses. Aguma, the report said, had stated that he was unable to deal with the SABC as at the time of inquiry by legal services, he was under suspension. According to the report: “The identification… of certain people is not conclusive of judging that they misled the inquiry. The evidence contained in the final report of the ad hoc committee creates a reality of conflicting testimony, but not necessarily that which is false or misleading.” At yesterday’s meeting, the committee decided to obtain a presentation from Parliament’s legal services before taking any further action. “We must bring in legal services to advise us on the course of action,” said committee chairman Humphrey Maxegwana. The ANC’s Sisisi Tolashe said the recommendations by the committee should be acted on. Once you lie to Parliament, you must go to jail,” she said. The DA’s Phumzile van Damme said criminal charges should be laid against those implicated in the report.
