Presented by the eThekwini Municipality, the awards recognise individuals, fashion designers, models and fashion houses for their promotion and growth of the fashion industry in South Africa. Yesterday, Mposo said: “Thank you Durban Fashion Fair and the eThekwini Municipality for the recognition. "The award is even more special since it's coming from my hometown. “Thank you Independent Media for the various platforms to tell stories of South Africans, who are making waves across all platforms. "It's a win for the Indy team; let us continue being a leading publishing house. “It's a privilege and honour for me to be in a position to document and tell stories of talented individuals we have in the fashion and arts industry. "Stories that inspire a nation and recognise people who are working hard in their chosen fields.” Mbuso Khoza, president of Independent Media Solutions’ Lifestyle division, congratulated Mposa and said: “The entire team is flattered by her latest achievement.
