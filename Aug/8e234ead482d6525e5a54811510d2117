A Kuils River motorist says he was pulled over and harassed by an “arrogant white man” flashing blue in his private vehicle early on Sunday morning. Jimlin van Wyk said had pulled over at the KFC in Van Riebeeck Road, Kuils River, when he noticed a white Volkswagen Polo in his rear view. “He was flashing blue lights so I thought it was a member of the City’s “ghost squad”, he asked to see my driver's licence which I gave,” said Van Wyk. When he asked the man for identification, he refused, Van Wyk said. “I didn’t want to get into an altercation because he was armed and instead recorded the aftermath of the incident with my cellphone,” said Van Wyk. Van Wyk said he reported the incident to the Kuils River police station where officers on duty acknowledged knowing the man pulling over motorists, but refused to take his complaint. “Instead of taking my complaint, they recorded the incident in the “overnight book”. Police officers allegedly told Van Wyk that the man was a member of the local neighbourhood watch. Chairperson of the Soneike Neighbourhood Watch Andre Kruger yesterday said he had no knowledge of the incident, adding that his members did not driver around flashing blue lights. “We have white lights on all our vehicles. No incident was reported to me,” said Kruger. * See more on this story in Monday's Cape Times
