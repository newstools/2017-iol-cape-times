A press conference was held yesterday in the CBD consisting of former regional task team (RTT) and regional executive committee(REC) members. Former RTT member Mesuli Kama said they represented ANCYL members from across the province. “Some have called us disgruntled and ill-disciplined, but we are worried about the movement and those who consider themselves in charge are determined to see the youth league die in their hands. “The current six members of the provincial executive committee (PEC) were elected on February 20, 2015, at a special conference and according to the ANCYL constitution the term of office for elected provincial executive is two years.” He said they therefore considered the decisions of this executive committee since February 21 of this year as “illegal and unconstitutional”. Several letters had been written to the office of the secretary-general of the ANCYL, Njabulo Nzuza, but there had been no response, Kama said. Provincial ANCYL chairperson Muhammad Khalid Sayed said: “The NEC determines when we hold conference and we were elected and they (activists) were selected by the committee.” ANCYL national spokesperson Bandile Masuku did not respond to calls and messages left for him.
