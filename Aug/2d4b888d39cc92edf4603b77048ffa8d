Windsor Park residents and neighbourhood watch members held a night vigil for murdered neighbourhood watch member Alec du Toit last night. It is reported Du Toit was killed after he approached two suspicious-looking men in Tennant Street, Kraaifontein. One of the suspects allegedly stabbed him in the heart. 30-year-old Du Toit died minutes later after he collapsed in the street. Police confirmed Du Toit was murdered on Friday at about 8:.30pm. Two suspects have since been arrested and will appear in court on charges of murder. Messages of condolences poured in for the 'fallen hero' over the weekend. Bellville CPCF cluster chairperson Lesley Ashton said the murder was a tragedy and said a planned workshop later this month would focus on the role of neighbourhood watches as the voluntary extended arm of police, acting as the eyes and ears on the street. Hennie Koekemoer from the Bellville CPF said the passing of Du Toit was "very sad". "We can all learn from and through it. It does leave us worried as being a part of a neighbourhood watch is always a known risk. Every neighbourhood watch member (when on patrol) is at risk," he said.
