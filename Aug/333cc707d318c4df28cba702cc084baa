The suspects, aged 26 to 34, had been arrested after reportedly abducting the man at about 10.30am in Ashton, said police spokesperson Andre Traut. “It was reported that the victim they took away from home at Zolani in Ashton was found lying near Bonnievale with three gunshot wounds and admitted to hospital. “ The suspects face charges of abduction and illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. Traut said Provincial Crime Combat Unit officers deployed in the Worcester area had been responding to information about a red VW Polo with four men driving away from the crime scene. They had spotted the vehicle and forced its occupants to surrender at Robertson Road, where it enters Worcester from Ashton. “The four suspects were searched and found with three 9mm pistols and a .38 Special revolver,” said Traut. Asked for more information about the suspects and their victim, Traut replied that the matter was still under investigation.  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
