According to FNB Household and Property Sector strategist John Loos, the Western Cape’s cumulative house price inflation has come in at 53.7% compared to the KwaZulu-Natal’s 30%, the Eastern Cape’s 26.6% and Gauteng’s 24.7%. Dogon Property Group rental agent Mick Brandt, who recently concluded the lease agreement for the Bantry Bay property, said that in 12 years of working in the sector he had never concluded a deal of such magnitude. The same company also recently concluded an eye-watering R450 000 a month lease for a Constantia estate. The company would not reveal pictures of either location over security concerns. “Prices like this, we don’t achieve. The property was not even on the market when it got snapped up because the lessor really wanted it.” He said that on average, rentals on the Atlantic Seaboard, which stretches from De Waterkant to Hout Bay, ranged from R20 000 a month for a one-bedroomed apartment to R100 000 a month for a four- or five-bedroomed house.
