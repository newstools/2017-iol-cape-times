Siphosethu Phikelela, 22, said she was herself a victim of abuse by an ex-boyfriend. Her poetry has enabled her to win numerous competitions, including the 2016 Open Book Festival Poetry Slam and the Khayamandi Arts and Cultural Festival Slam. In February, she co-founded Imbewu Book Club as a tool of transformation in Cape Town communities. She writes in Xhosa and believes everyone should express themselves in a language they are comfortable speaking. “There are many children who are abused. Not just physical abuse, but emotional abuse too. Sometimes, things such as school uniforms, books and food are causes of a child being depressed. “I was part of an abusive relationship myself, it is not easy to leave a relationship when you love someone but when you've had enough, enough is enough. I told Social Development MEC (Albert) Fritz about my situation and filed a case against my ex- boyfriend. “But my story is just the beginning of what others suffer daily, that is why every Saturday I am a part of the Imbewu Book Club, where we distribute books to children from poor backgrounds. "This gives them confidence to excel at school and in the environment around them as they are within a group of other kids and share laughter  that is good to see,” said Phikelela. She says every day she works on her craft and it was not about winning prizes but the lives she touched through her storytelling. “When I'm not doing the book club or working on my poetry or doing peer mentorship, I intern at the C.Y.P.H.E.R (Cape Youth Poetry Hub for Expression and Rhythm) and work on enhancing my administrative skills,” she said. Local poet, writer and performer, Siphokazi Jonas said that Siphosethu’s talent is an inspiration to young women and children. “She is a young talented and important poet, who is the guardian of our mother tongue (Xhosa),” said Jonas.
