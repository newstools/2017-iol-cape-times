ANA chief executive Grant Fredericks said: “This service propels Africa into newsrooms and boardrooms.” ANA is a syndicated news and information service distributing African content internationally. It was launched in 2015. The easy-to-use and cloud-based ANA PR Wire is free to access and anyone can register. ANA chief editor Lindiz van Zilla said: “It was always ANA’s intention that while we would start off with a South African platform, our focus would be continental, and our reach would be global, and I think this PR wire service speaks to those goals and ambitions.” The technology enables contributors to upload their own news, pictures and data effectively. ANA head of news and content Melanie Cheary said: “The ANA PR Wire empowers Africans, from all countries, to share their own news with an international audience. "Clients may also access ANA’s daily, monthly, quarterly and annual media monitoring, tracking and analysis reports, giving them a 360-degree PR measurement and management tool." Businesses, non-profit organisations and the government can publish information at competitive rates. Press releases and images are uploaded online by paying contributors.The platform can be accessed at: http://pr.africannewsagency.com/
