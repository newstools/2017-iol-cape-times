With an average of 7 500 vegetation fires in Cape Town every summer, the service recruits candidates every year to intensify its firefighting efforts between November and April. Over the past week, more than 1 800 participants went through the first stage, a basic fitness test at the City’s Ndabeni facility. The assessment included a reach test, a 2.4km run within a prescribed time, 30 sit-ups within 60 seconds, 30 push-ups within 60 seconds and a 50kg dead load carry over 100m. “This fitness assessment is standard. On paper it might not seem that daunting, but I would venture a guess that many people would struggle to complete the tasks. "I want to congratulate those candidates who persevered and commiserate with those who didn't make it this time around,” said the City’s Mayco member for safety, security and social services, JP Smith. A total of 846 candidates successfully completed the basic fitness assessment. During the next stage, they will be required to complete written and behavioural assessments. The top overall performers will be offered contracts as seasonal firefighters and will start training on November 1. Seasonal firefighters are expected to work at least 40 hours a week for the duration of their contracts, under the guidance and supervision of firefighters and officers. “We experience between 6 000-9 000 vegetation fires during summer in Cape Town. Our seasonal recruits are crucial to our efforts to protect lives and property during this very busy period,” Smith added. Earlier this year, the City reported that from November 1, 2016,  to January 12, 2017, fire and rescue services responded to 5 465 fires, an average of about 75 a day. About 80% of the incidents were classified as bush, grass, or rubbish fires. Cape Times
