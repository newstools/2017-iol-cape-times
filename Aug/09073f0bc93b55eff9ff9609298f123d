UWC launched the Access To Success campaign, which focuses on providing much-needed funding to students who are performing well academically but who cannot afford university fees. Ralase considers herself a late bloomer after matriculating from St Francis Adult Education Centre in Langa, but only got the opportunity to study at the age of 46. When her twin sister Ncikazi fell pregnant in the year they were supposed to start university, Khulukazi decided she was willing to put her education plans on hold and look after her sister’s baby until her sister finished her degree. Her desire to study further continued to grow as she saw her twin sister’s progress in her studies, especially when she realised that there were opportunities in the form of the Recognition of Prior 
Learning (RPL) programme at UWC. She said: “This programme paved the way for me and now I am ready to make a difference in my community. “I want to pursue the dream of officially launching a programme called Keep Them Safe, aimed at preventing children from committing crimes, focusing on youth 
development.” After having to complete a bridging course in 2013, she was only able to apply successfully in 2014. But there are still challenges to overcome: unreliable public transport, the financial struggle of fees, textbooks, and a home environment where she does not have her own study space. “I have to wait for everyone to go to sleep. “That is the only time I have to study, and sometimes my studies give me uphill (battles) too, and I struggle with a few modules, but I’m learning to keep pushing through. “Access To Success is a great campaign to help students who cannot afford university fees. It will play a big role in ending the FeesMustFall campaign, giving access for students like myself from previously disadvantaged areas to 
succeed and help others in the process.”
