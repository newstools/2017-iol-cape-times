De Lille and Mkhwebane visited the informal settlement for an inspection. The City had received two directives instructing it to clean the canals. A settlement agreement would be signed between De Lille and Mkhwebane on delivery of basic services for the township, after the City's legal team had overseen and made proposed amendments. Community leader Dumisani Nhlapo said the residents of Masiphumelele were not informed of the visit. “We were surprised when the mayor and the public protector came today, but feel we should have been consulted by the City. This agreement means nothing if the City continues to exclude us from the process and the public protector must act as a mediator and ensure they stick to their promises,” said Nhlapo. De Lille showed the delegation the developments and cleaning progress being conducted in the area and said that the myth must be debunked that the City does not care about Masiphumelele. “The circumstance in Masiphumelele will not improve, unless we deal with the overcrowding. "We have over 200 informal settlements we need to assist and I am appealing to the residents to give back public space in order for the City to provide more facilities,” said De Lille. She said there would be weekly reports sent to the public protector and that the City would continue working with the community. Mkhwebane said once the settlement agreement is signed, it would ensure the City would co-operate in finding permanent solutions for Masiphumelele. If the City does not comply, it would result in a full on investigation by her office, said Mkhwebane.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
