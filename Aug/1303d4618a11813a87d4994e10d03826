The Department of International Relations and Co-operation has denied that Zimbabwean First Lady Grace Mugabe will be granted diplomatic immunity despite reports emerging that she will be. Reuters has quoted a government source who said thatÂ there was "no way" Mugabe, 52, would be arrested for the alleged assault, but that Pretoria expected the granting of diplomatic immunity to be challenged in court. Spokesperson for Dirco Nelson Kgwete said Mugabe "does not have diplomatic immunity" and denied reports that she would be granted a chance to escape justice. Kgwete said he knows nothing about the reports.

"We are waiting in anticipation as well," Naidoo said. "People are attacking us left, right and center but we can't do anything." A storm of controversy has surrounded Mugabe with calls for her to be arrested. On Thursday the victim of the attack, Gabrielle Engels, said she had been offered money to drop the case. She said she wanted justice and called for Mugabe not to be granted immunity. Earlier in the week, the SAPS said Zimbabwean officials would be applying for diplomatic immunity as Mugabe was in the country to attend the SADC Summit. This was after the Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula said Mugabe would appear in court. Politics Hub and AP
