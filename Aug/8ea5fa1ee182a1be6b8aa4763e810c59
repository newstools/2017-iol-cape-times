The festival, running until August 31, will see up to 15 schools at a time sharing the same stage in the theatre. This forms part of the Artscape’s ongoing vision to develop a love for the performing arts within the youth. Inclusive Arts Unit director, Thokozile Ntshinga, said the arts have a central role to play in nation building. “Therefore, the Schools’ Arts Festival gives learners the opportunity to showcase their talent on a professional stage. Furthermore, the festival also stimulates a love for theatre and the performing arts,” said Ntshinga. She said the festival allows pupils to obtain theatre discipline while encouraging nation-building, as youth and their parents from different cultural backgrounds come together. This year’s festival culminates with a gala event on August 31, which will be adjudicated by Charles Banjatwa, Sifiso Kweyama and Tarnia van Zitters. The judges will select 20 schools on merit, who will be sponsored with transport, by the HCI Foundation, to the Artscape Theatre Centre. The 2017 Schools’ Arts Festival was initiated and coordinated by Artscape’s School Liaison Unit with funding by the HCI Foundation. Tickets for the event are R40 per person and are available through the Artscape Dial-a-Seat on 0214217839 and Computicket.
