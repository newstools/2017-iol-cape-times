Deputy Higher Education and Training Minister Mduduzi Manana has resigned, the Presidency announced on Saturday. “President Jacob Zuma has received and accepted the resignation of the deputy minister of Higher Education and Training Mr Mduduzi Manana,” it said in a statement. Zuma had thanked Manana for his “contribution to the work of government” during his term of office. Manana, 34, has been under fire since he allegedly assaulted Mandisa Duma and a friend at a Fourways, Johannesburg, nightclub two weeks ago. He has subsequently issued a public apology, but said he had acted following “extreme provocation”. Man Manana was granted R5 000 bail in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on August 10 on two counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The case was postponed to September 13. He has reportedly also faced assault charges in the past, including allegations of routinely abusing his staff. African News Agency
