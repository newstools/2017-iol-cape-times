Johannesburg - Barely a week after video footage emerged showing a couple being assaulted at a KFC in Pretoria, two more videos depicted similar attacks have emerged on social media. The videos, one posted on Twitter and the other on Facebook, show the assault of two people at an Ocean Basket restaurant and KFC outlet. In the first video, an Ocean Basket franchisee is seen repeatedly slapping a worker and then kicking him. The incident reportedly happened at the Lakefield franchise in Benoni and it remains unclear what sparked the attack. The video has since gone viral, leaving users shocked and sparking much outrage.    In the second video, posted by Piko Sipunzi on Facebook, shows a white man can be seen repeatedly slapping Sipunzi following an altercation at a KFC in Westville. In the post, Sipunzi explains that the incident unfolded while he was making his way through the drive-thru. "We were both waiting in drive through for our meals. This man then started hooting at me as if I was the one delaying our food inside," Sipunzi explained. "Well after he hooted hooting repeatedly I opened my window and asked him what was his problem. After this he started calling me a p***y and a K*** of a black person." The other driver then allegedly proceeded to assault Sipunzi, seemingly for no reason and this was then captured on video.   Ocean Basket has since spoken out on the matter, adding that the man has since been disenfranchised. IOL
