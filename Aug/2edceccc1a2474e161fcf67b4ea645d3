The organisation handed over a cheque to the university’s deputy vice-chancellor, Chris Nhlapo, at the Bellville campus yesterday. “Once you are empowered and have an education you are able to become self-sustainable and change your life,” said Sanzaf general manager Yasmina Francke. Sanzaf is a faith-based, socio-welfare and educational organisation that works to facilitate the empowerment of needy families. Lansdowne third-year biotechnology student, Sara Salie, 22, has been a beneficiary for the last two years. This was after her mother, who is a single parent, struggled financially to get her through first year. “I am very grateful. Without this donation, I would not have gotten this far. We are three children and things were tough at home. "There was a possibility that I would have had to stop studying until I heard about the organisation through a friend,” she said. Salie now offers her time to help tutor younger students as her way of giving back. Francke said the organisation was happy to be able to help deserving students. With their approach, she said Sanzaf aimed to empower. “You can’t keep giving fish, you have to teach people to catch the fish,”  she added. She said the organisation wanted to “change a person from being a victim, to being a change agent”. Nhlapo said the university welcomed the donation because many students faced challenges in terms of paying their tuition fees and accommodation. “I am very excited about this donation. “ I think it is coming at just the right time. We are all aware of the dire situation in South Africa, particularly relating to funding so any contribution is welcome,” he said.  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
