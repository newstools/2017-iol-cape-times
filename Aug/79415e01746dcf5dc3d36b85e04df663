The two provincial leaderships  described the meeting held in Joburg 
 yesterday as “historic and long overdue”. “The two PWCs (provincial working committees) agreed to continue with bilateral engagements among themselves and other provinces ahead of the 54th national conference,” Mabuza and his Gauteng counterpart Paul Mashatile said. “We have collectively agreed to take critical steps in the next four months to work very hard to foster unity and cohesion not only within 
the ANC, but within the broader society. "Furthermore, we will develop a joint programme of action between now and December 2017, to have meaningful engagements with all ANC structures in our respective provinces and other provinces.” Mabuza was once a staunch supporter of President Jacob Zuma and part of the so-called “premier league”, a faction led by Mpumalanga, Free State and North West premiers which relentlessly defended and supported Zuma. The "premier league’s" influence has since weakened after Mabuza started preaching unity and 
thwarting the factionalism in the ANC. The Free State, led by chairman and premier Ace Magashule, has aligned itself with Zuma’s stronghold and home province, KwaZulu-Natal.
