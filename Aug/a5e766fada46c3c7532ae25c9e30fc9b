Woodville Primary won the primary school category. Each winning school took home R20 000 and the runner-up, Cedar High School, won R10 000. The annual event, now in its sixth year, was held at the Liberty Promenade Shopping Centre in Mitchells Plain on Saturday with 16 schools that competed. This year, participants were asked to create a superhero outfit from recycled materials and a poster to raise awareness of the social harm that bullying causes in schools. The schools competed for the top prize by dressing their superheroes in recycled materials from head to toe, driving home the anti-bullying campaign. Mondale High School and their superhero, “Heroine of Harmony”, were stoked with the win and said their hard work and efforts had paid off, as they had worked tirelessly for two weeks creating their recycled masterpiece. The Generation Green Recycled Fashion Show saw the schools go head to head in a competitive show featuring unique outfits designed and modelled by pupils themselves. The stipulation was that pupils had to incorporate recycled materials in their design. Dorothea Wright, general manager for Liberty Promenade, said: “The benefit of the annual recycling stipulation means that pupils are encouraged to be resourceful in their re-use of discarded materials and we hope will begin to seek ways of recycling waste. “Bullying is a scourge on young children, who are especially vulnerable to the effects of harsh and unkind words from their peers. "Parents can do a lot to intervene, but ultimately, children themselves need to learn to recognise and reject bullying from as young an age as possible.” This year's superhero theme came to life with outfits inspired by Wonder Woman, Batman and many others. Creativity abounded in the form of capes made from CDs and black rubbish bags, wire-net skirts and outfits made of discarded washing powder and potato chip packets.
