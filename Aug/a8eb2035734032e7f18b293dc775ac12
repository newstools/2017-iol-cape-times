Monica Dube did not take the stand to testify during the second leg of the Timol inquest, but an affidavit made by her was handed to the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, yesterday. She said a “big and strong”  security police officer  asked her, a few days into her detention in mid-1984, why she would not co-operate with them. “He said ‘do you think Timol jumped or was pushed? We pushed him and that is going to happen to you'.” The time of Timol's death, meanwhile, remains a mystery, with the security police maintaining it was late afternoon, while two witnesses were adamant it was mid-morning. A pathologist recalled to the stand was unable to say whether it was morning or afternoon. Dr Steve Naidoo said it was equally possible that Timol could have plunged to his death in mid-morning or mid-afternoon. He said the report issued by the doctor who declared Timol dead was inadequate. The doctor saw the body late in the afternoon on the day of the fall and simply noted that Timol had “recently died”. Dr Torie Pretorius, acting for the National Director of Public Prosecutions, said his office had been approached by several potential witnesses who claimed they could shed more light on Timol’s death. This was after Judge Billy Mothe called on the public or anyone present when Timol fell to come forward. The judge said yesterday his registrar had received calls from former security police agents who claimed they could assist. Over the next few days, Pretorius and his team will work through the potential witnesses. These included the mystery witness expected to take the stand yesterday. Monday to Wednesday next week had been set aside to hear this new evidence. Only the evidence of witnesses who were present that day and could truly assist would be heard at this stage. The proceedings resume on Monday.
