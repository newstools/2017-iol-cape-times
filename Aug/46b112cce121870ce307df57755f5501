Student activist Mcebo Dlamini said yesterday the ANC was arrogant and hypocritical for granting free higher education despite a number of student leaders still facing charges related to Fees Must Fall protests. Dlamini appeared briefly in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on charges of violating a court order, public violence, assault, theft and damage to property. He was arrested in October, but was released on R2 000 bail in November in the high court sitting in Palm Ridge. “The ANC have indicated they were willing to roll out free education in 2018, but as student leaders we might be forced to reject that offer,” he said. “If push comes to shove we can still mobilise today, and it won't be nice. None of the students know we are here, but we might be forced.” Earlier, Dlamini told the court he needed to seek alternative legal representatives, as his legal counsel didn't pitch up for proceedings. “For unforeseen reasons my legal representatives didn't make it to court, hence I've decided to get a new attorney.” He was warned by the court that no further postponements would be allowed, so it was vital for him to ensure that he appointed someone to represent him at his next appearance. The matter was postponed to August 29.
