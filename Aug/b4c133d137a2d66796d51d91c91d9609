Durban - Ok, this seems more a case of students goofing around than some act of heroism, but in the end the message was clear: donâ€™t park like a tool in our campus parking lot. The lads in the video, which appears to have been taken at a campus in Durban, initially moved the car to make way for an acquaintance in a VW Fox. But soon after, the group moved the errant Toyota Tazz into a perpendicular position, presumably in order to send a strong message to the owner.   IOL Motoring
