The ANC Women’s League president Bathabile Dlamini is a disgrace. Fancy making a statement that there are other senior government leaders who are worse culprits than Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training Mduduzi Manana? That doesn’t make what he did right. If she knows who these other culprits are, what is she and the ANCWL doing about it? She also announced that the League wouldn’t call for Manana’s removal. I am gobsmacked that someone in her position who is supposed to stand up for women’s rights can have this attitude. She should not be in the position she holds in the ANCWL when she is clearly out of her depth. Is Manana being treated with kid gloves because he is in President Jacob Zuma’s camp? As is Dlamini. One wants to tear one’s hair out with a woman like this. She carries on putting her foot in it by saying that “I don’t care whether there is a case (against Manana)” adding too, “how many cases of violence against women and children are reported?” I have to ask, what point is she making here? Manana has admitted he assaulted these women whereas others patently haven’t come forward. But if she knows who they are why is she and other ANCWL members not yelling from the roof tops about this. One has to wonder why there even is a ANCWL as patently they are not doing enough for women as we can see from the rapes, murders and assaults on womenfolk on a daily basis in our country #Dlamini must go!!!!!!
