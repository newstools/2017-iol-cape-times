Cape Town - Capetonians should brace themselves for some more chilly weather, with snowfalls expected today and tomorrow in parts of the province. Stella Nake of Weather SA said snowfalls are expected over the high-lying areas of the Western Cape and the southern parts of the Northern Cape on Tuesday and again on Thursday. â€œA cold front is expected to make landfall this afternoon over the southwestern parts of the province, resulting in rain-showers spreading eastwards and to the north and persisting into tomorrow evening (Tuesday)," she said. Nake said the same set up is expected on Wednesday into Thursday, where rain-showers are expected during Wednesday late morning over the extreme south-western parts of the Western Cape, spreading to the north and to the east by Thursday morning. "Good rainfall amounts is expected ranging from 10-15mm and 20-30mm for the mountainous in the southwest and the southern parts of the province and about 5-10mm in the north," she said. Snow Report SA says it looks like the cold front has reached the Western Cape already, with light snow possible over all the Western Cape high peaks by Tuesday morning, and in the south western parts of the Northern Cape. This system will then head south and exit the country by Tuesday evening. Another system will make landfall late on Wednesday in the Western Cape, and snow is once again possible over the high peaks in the Western Cape, but not much snow is expected with the second system, Snow Report SA said.  lisa.isaacs@inl.co.za  Cape Times
