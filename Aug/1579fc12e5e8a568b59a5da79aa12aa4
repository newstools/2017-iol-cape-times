Thandile Wilbarforce Salman, 34, appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crime Court in Bellville before magistrate Sabrina Sonnenberg, who sentenced Salman to nine years' imprisonment, of which three were suspended. Salman pleaded not guilty and maintained his innocence to the end. The magistrate said Salman was an intelligent person “with a bright future ahead”. She said Salman had used the bank accounts of friends and family in order to divert money fraudulently obtained to himself. “In some instances, you even lied to them about the reason that you needed to use their bank accounts.” Sonnenberg added: “Lies are often the seeds that grow into fraudulent trees.” It seemed to the court that the new national sport in South Africa was public officials looting the coffers of municipalities, as if there were no tomorrow, she said. The Western Cape head of the Hawks, Major-General Nombuso Khoza, welcomed the sentence and commended the investigation team for “sterling work done”. “Corruption is counter-productive to effective governance. Given our constitutional mandate to fight it, we will ensure this is done tooth and nail. " We hope this (sentence) will deter would-be corrupt officials; it’s an indication we mean business,” Khoza said.
