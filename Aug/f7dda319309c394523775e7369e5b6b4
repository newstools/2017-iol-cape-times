The ANC was the first to propose that the names of the current interim board - chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama, deputy chairperson Mathatha Tsedu, Krish Naidoo, John Matisonn and Febe Potgieter-Gqubule - be on the shortlist. The proposal was supported by the EFF and Cope, representing small parties, with the DA nominating only Tsedu, Kweyama and Matisonn. Independent Communications Authority of South Africa board member Nomvuyiso Batyi was unanimously nominated for the shortlist. Rachel Kalidass, a former board member, was nominated by all parties except the EFF. Former SABC head of news Snuki Zikalala and former ANC Youth League deputy president Ronald Lamola did not make the cut after being nominated by the ANC. Zikalala’s nomination drew laughter from some of the opposition parties when it was read out by ANC’s Mziwamadoda Kalako. The committee plans to reach an agreement on the 12 names to fill the permanent board on September 4, just a day before the National Assembly meets to make recommendations to President Jacob Zuma.
