The SAPS has urged citizens to act responsibly during the planned protest marches by political parties and civil society in Cape Town on Monday and Tuesday ahead of the National Assembly debate on a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday afternoon. The SAPS in the Western Cape, together with all law enforcement agencies in Cape Town, were "operationally preparing" for the approved planned marches to Parliament, Brigadier Novela Potelwa said. An operational plan was developed under the auspices of the provincial joint operational and intelligence structure (ProvJOINTS) in anticipation of "scores of people descending on the city centre on both days". The joint operational centre (JOC) would be activated on Monday morning and police and other security personnel would henceforth maintain a visible presence at identified strategic positions in an effort to ensure safety and security for all, Potelwa said. "The other objective of the deployments will be to ensure free flow of traffic. Road closures in and around the CBD will be made available by the City of Cape Town's traffic services. "Business owners are advised to exercise discretion in relation to operating hours on the days in question. March organisers and participants are urged to conduct themselves within the parameters of the law. "As law enforcement agencies within the ProvJOINTS we recognise citizensâ€™ right to protest. However, the right to protest comes with responsibility. Destruction of property, looting and other unlawful conduct will not be tolerated," Potelwa said. African News Agency
