An open letter to the president: President Zuma you have repeatedly revealed your own moral bankruptcy, and now you presume that all ANC members are equally so. The telling quote from your address to a cadres forum in Phongolo are the words: “It’s even rare that ANC members want to use their conscience.” Only a man whose own conscience has been totally seared and silenced could make such a suggestion. How insulting! How arrogant! How patently untrue! ANC members, who have stood firm for truth, who strive for a non-racial society, who have suffered much in their determined quest for a more just and equitable society, have not done so because the party instructed them to do so. They have done so because they are convinced that it is the right, noble, good, and true thing to do, they continually use their consciences. Do not presume that all ANC members are as morally bankrupt as you are. Members of Parliament differed in the way they voted in the secret ballot. Do not now insult those who conscientiously voted for the good of the nation, and the good of the ANC, by presuming that they have no conscience like you. These very members will act with conviction, in good conscience when you are fired for failure to uphold the constitution; when you are charged for corruption and when you are convicted. There is hope for you, Mr President.  At present you have no conscience, and no conviction. That is soon to change. There are 783 or more convictions coming your way. With the kind regards of every ANC member with a conscience. Ron Eardley East London
