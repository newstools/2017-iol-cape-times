I am dismayed at the amount of publicity given to the matter of the Wynberg school haircut fiascoâ€‹. It shows just how pathetic and dysfunctional we are as a society where everything is referred to in racial terms. This is a simple case of obeying the rules and the letter would have been sent to the parents of any pupil, no matter what colour he was. Sadly this family seems to think the rules are made for someone else and not them and they probably, like a large section of the population, prefer to disobey rules and regulations which is why we are in such a mess. School is one place that tries to treat everyone equally and teach them that rules are made for the benefit of everyone and why they should be observed. Many parents send completely bad mannered and unruly children to the schools expecting them to sort them out, and then when there is a problem the school is always at fault, although their hands are tied when it comes to proper discipline.
