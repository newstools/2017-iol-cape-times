Valencia Hector, mother of the 10-year-old girl and 15-year-old boy, said her children were on their way to school when they came across the body in an open field used as a thoroughfare while a housing development takes shape in the area. “My daughter came running home shortly after they left for school and said they had seen a body. They saw her feet under the black plastic bag she was wrapped in,”  said Hector. The woman’s bloodied body was found metres away from a substation in Gotha Street. It is suspected it was dumped during the night. “My son was traumatised and decided to stay home from school. However, my daughter, who loves school, went back after the police were alerted. Both will receive trauma counselling.” The woman, believed  to be in her early thirties, was dressed in navy tracksuit pants, a grey top with red dots, blue socks and a black scarf was wrapped around her head.
