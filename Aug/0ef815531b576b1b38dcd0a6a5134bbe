He was arrested for contravening a protection order and for public violence. His arrest was related to his alleged assault of security officers in June. Bleki spent 21 days at the Goodwood Prison before he was granted R3000 bail on Thursday. His bail application was scheduled to be heard on September 7. But his lawyers filed an urgent High Court application, which was successful. “Even the inmates are people who understand our cause as students and appreciate what we do. "It touches them. When they hear that you are fighting for the accessibility of education, they encourage you and understand very well that it is a noble cause,” he said. Bleki claimed that students often ended up facing criminal charges because they were raising matters on behalf of workers. Yesterday Bleki’s lawyer, Xolani Ngculu, said: “We got bail. One of the conditions is that  whenever  he wants to visit the university, he must first get written permission. "I am not sure what the court was thinking when imposing such a stipulation because Bleki naturally has written permission to be there as a student. "I do not understand, but we will let that go because that is the judgment.” In 2015 Bleki was one of several students arrested during the #FeesMustFall protests. UWC spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo said: "UWC respects the law, court findings and conditions imposed by the courts. "Mr Bleki has not asked the university for permission to come to campus and we will wait for such permission to be asked for before commenting any further." Bleki will appear in court on September 14.
