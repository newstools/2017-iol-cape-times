In 2014, Jonas met and shared the stage with US poets Ezekiel Azonwu and Janette...ikz (pronounced genetics) on the Cape Town leg of their South African tour. They were part of an internationally renowned movement, Passion for Christ Movement (P4CM), which hosts the world’s largest spoken word event, Rhetoric. Jonas was encouraged to audition for the annual event. Two years later, she was accepted as one of five open mic acts to perform at Rhetoric 2016. This made her the first South African and African poet to perform at the event. She said it hosted a 3 500-strong audience and 3 000-5 000 online viewers. Last year when she attended the Music Exchange Conference (MEX), one of the topics by global technology analyst Arthur Goldstuck tackled how local artists could benefit from crowdfunding to support their careers. Jonas said: “What we need to do is to take advantage of technology, social media and the online space.” She said that crowdfunding had enabled her to tackle the South African and global poetry industry by connecting the country’s stories with the world, and that going to Rhetoric 2016 had a “definite and positive impact on that goal”. Martin Myers, who is Sipho “Hotstix” Mabuse’s music manager and the director of the Music Exchange Conference, said: “The moment Siphokazi walked out of the music exchange venue she went on to apply everything that she learnt, and right now she is doing a remarkable job all over South Africa and worldwide.”
