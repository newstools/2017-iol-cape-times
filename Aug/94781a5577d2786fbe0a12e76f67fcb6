Andreas Wolf faces eight sexually related charges and is currently out on bail of R200 000 granted by the Western Cape High Court, after it was denied in the Blue Downs Magistrate's Court. The German citizen  stands accused of sexual exploitation, rape, sexual assault and exposing children to pornography. Magistrate Vincent Ketye confirmed the case would be postponed until November 7 for further investigation. Ketye also ordered, upon the defence's request, that Wolf's driver's licence, bank cards and passport be returned to him by the Kleinvlei police station. Wolf stands accused of sexually penetrating an 11-year-old boy from Faure in Eersteriver. A mother of two of the boys, who may not be named as her sons are still minors, was angry Wolf was given bail. “He doesn't care what he does and was seen at the farm again this week. He is violating his bail conditions but because he has money he just does what he wants. "When we saw him we shouted at him that he knows he doesn't belong there. Next time we see him there we will smash his windscreen,” the mother warned. The accused allegedly groomed young boys so that he might perform sexual acts with them at his Somerset West home. At his bail application at Blue Downs Magistrate's Court, the State said the first alleged victim reported the matter last year.
