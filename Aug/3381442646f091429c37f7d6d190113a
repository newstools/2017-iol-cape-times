ANC MPs on Wednesday resolved to call Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane to explain his relationship with the Gupta family "now". Parliament's House chair Cedric Frolick had earlier directed the committee to conduct an inquiry into allegations in the media of Zwane's supposed corrupt relationship with the family. On Wednesday, committee chairman Sahlulele Luzipho informed the committee when he asked how the inquiry should be run, Frolick suggested that as a starting point the minister mustÂ be called to answer questions from MPs. DA MPs objected, saying this was akin to being "rammed through the committee without indicating what the process will be".  A vote was called, with the ANC MPs using their majority to immediately call Zwane. The committee adjourned so that one of the minister's advisers could call him to appear before MPs. Allegations against Zwane include that he used the Guptas' private jet to fly from Switzerland to Dubai, that the family paid for his medical expenses, and that he was involved in money laundering and racketeering during his days as Free State Agriculture MEC African News Agency
