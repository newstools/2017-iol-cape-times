Traffic services spokesperson Maxine Bezuidenhout said: “A 55-year-old man was cycling up the mountain just after 8am when he lost his footing and fell into the roadway.” A minibus taxi then allegedly drove over the cyclist. After the accident, traffic was delayed when one lane was closed, and the Simon’s Town southbound route was affected. In another incident, Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Robert Daniels said a rescue operation was conducted yesterday morning after a man was flung from his bakkie in Gordon's Bay. “An adult male was flung from his bakkie last night when it left Rooi Els Road near Gordon's Bay. ‘‘The vehicle landed in the ocean and the driver on the downhill slope above it," Daniels said. Emergency Medical Services made use of an AMS helicopter to bring the critically injured survivor to safety yesterday afternoon. The man was transported to hospital for further medical attention.
