She spoke on condition of anonymity in fear of victimisation: “I was standing 30m away from the incident beneath the Bonteheuwel-Langa bridge, when a guy smash-and-grabbed the passenger behind the driver of a small gold car at about 7.15am. “The driver two cars behind them jumped out, chased the suspect and fired two shots. The suspect, who was running in the direction of Langa, fell and then got up and ran again and fell again. “The last thing I saw was the shooter pick up the lady’s handbag and stuff lying outside the bag and put the stuff back in the bag.” It is unclear what had happened to the suspect. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith was unaware of the incident. “The City is aware of smash-and-grab incidents that take place at these hot spots. The metro intervenes in these incidents 60% of the time, but can’t deal with these incidents alone, they need support from the police.” Police spokesperson Leon Fortuin said they had no record of the incident.
