The Artscape Theatre was a hive of activity on Women’s Day as a number of organisations and its supporters joined forces for the annual Women’s Humanity Walk. SAFFI and Woman Zone, together with Artscape, hosted the walk which started at St George’s Cathedral at 9am. The theme this year was Uniting Cape Town Against Gender Based Violence, and, as always, everyone was welcome – women, children and men. More than 100 stakeholders exhibited their work throughout the day, and women had access to free health screenings offered by CANSA; legal advice and counselling, offered by the Southern Suburbs Legal Advice Centre. * For more on how the walk went, see the Cape Times on Thursday."
