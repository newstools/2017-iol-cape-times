Cape Town - EFF leader Julius Malema was in fine form during the debate on the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma. He started by salutingÂ Speaker Baleka Mbete for her courage in calling a secret ballot on the motion. Here's 5 things Malema told the National Assembly: "Ours is not against the ANC, but against the father of Duduzane, because Duduzane's father is the most corrupt individual in this country." "We have a problem with the Cabinet getting reshuffled by people who are not elected." "Deputy President you are writing your own history." "Next time you must bring breathalysers here!" "I withdraw, I want to vote a crook out." IOL
