A domestic worker suffered head, thigh and hand injuries after she was mauled by her employer's two pit bulls. Lilian Mkosi, 57, was discharged from Groote Schuur Hospital six days after the July 29 attack. She can’t walk and is unable to work at the moment. Cape of Good Hope SPCA chief executive Allan Perrins said the pitbulls have since been “put to sleep permanently”.
