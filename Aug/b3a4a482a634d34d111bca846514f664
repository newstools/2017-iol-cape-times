Opposition parties have welcomed Parliament Speaker Baleka Mbete's decision to hold the no confidence vote against President Jacob Zuma through a secret ballot. They said now the ball was in the ANC MPs' court to decide whether they will follow party protocol or vote to remove Zuma. Mbete made the decision of a secret vote on Monday, saying the decision was made after taking due consideration on submissions made by opposition parties and the Constitutional Court. The DA said ANC MPs now have no excuse and should use their vote on Tuesday to vote against corruption by removing President Jacob Zuma. EFF leader Julius Malema said his party was more than confident that they would have the desired numbers to vote Zuma out. "We are working very hard, we are not going sleep. We are speaking to all members of Parliament. If Baleka can go against party line so can ANC MPs," said Malema. "We are talking to members of the ANC. Many of them have told us that if it is secret, he is gone," he said.  While the FF Plus said Mbete’s decision showed courage, it urged the ANC MPs to realise the seriousness of the vote of no confidence and support it. The ANC has also welcomed the decision, but said it had full confidence in its members to toe the party line and retain party loyalty. "The ANC reiterates its stance that we have full confidence in the ANC Caucus and individual members of parliament deployed by the African National Congress. We do not nor have we ever doubted their loyalty and discipline in relation to the decisions of the movement," said the ANC in a statement. ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu noted Mbete's decision, but said they would continue to oppose the vote.  "We have full confidence in our ANC members of Parliament. This motion, just like others before it, will be defeated," said Mthembu. Last week Mthembu had said removing Zuma would be like “throwing an nuclear bomb”. Politics and Development Hub
