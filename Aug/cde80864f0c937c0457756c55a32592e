I refer to your article on page 1 on Wednesday, August 2, with the headline “Judge slams education bosses”. Once again the Western Cape Education Department has demonstrated its “kragdadigheid” towards the poor in this province. Helen Zille and Debbie Schäfer should be replaced immediately. It is a shame that poor pupils whose only hope to a decent life is through education are denied a school nearest to their place of residency. The uncertainty under which these pupils, parents and teachers must live is unacceptable. The “cocktail queen” of WCED is more interested in selling liquor at schools, getting businesses to invest in collaborative schools with huge tax cuts and setting up a money-making evaluation unit instead of addressing the important issues in education like more teachers in poor schools, opening teacher training colleges with progressive teaching methods and a more understanding attitude towards teachers etc. WCED will go out of its way to sort out problems in schools of the rich. San Souci High School is an example. It is time that the people in the Western Cape resist this master-slave attitude of the DA-run WCED. The ANC should shame itself in allowing this to happen in the Western Cape. Brian Isaacs Chairperson Western Cape Parent Teacher Student Forum (est 1996)
