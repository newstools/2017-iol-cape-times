“I am so proud, they’ve worked so hard, they totally deserve to have won. The song they performed they literally arranged earlier this week,” said Megan Marais, relative of group member Kevin Smuts. The group is made up of Amy Campbell, 25, Daniel Nambassi, 27, Leah Adams, 25, Smuts, 31 and Morné Kahps, 27. They arrived back in Cape Town yesterday, welcomed by local fans, family and media at Cape Town International Airport. Performing a medley of South African golden oldies, saw AnecNote win over the public and grabbing the most votes to win the talent show. Smuts said he could not believe the result. “We’re all in a state of shock and I don’t think it has quite sunken in yet. At the same time, we’re so excited about the result and want to work super hard to keep the dream alive,” he said. AnecNote were DJ Fresh’s golden buzzer in the theatre auditions and they lived up to high expectations in the live finals. An ecstatic Daniel Nambassi said: “This is a win for a cappella all over South Africa, we are extremely happy. Thank you, SA.” Marlon Davids, e.tv managing director, said he was impressed by the amount of talent that was on show this year. “We cannot thank all the acts that auditioned to showcase their talent, e.tv is thrilled to have unearthed so many great acts this year and we are proud of AnecNote for winning the competition,” he said. Art Of Dance and Amazebra placed second and third respectively.  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
