With reference to Mugabe told to leave. We have been watching the events unfolding in Harare with awe and wonder. Very quietly the Zimbabwean army took over key points in Harare and placed Robert and Grace Mugabe under house arrest last Wednesday. Mugabeâ€™s brutal 37 years are now at an end and his people are rejoicing and looking for a brighter future when he is impeached. Our President Jacob Zuma should be watching these events in fear and horror. The writing is on the wall. Zuma is next to fall. South Africans are not going to keep quiet indefinitely. Our president and his allies, the Guptas, have raped and bankrupted the country, doing what they will with state-owned enterprises, stealing billions and bringing our economy to the brink of ruin. How many more downgrades do we have to face? While you can step down without bloodshed, do this instead of being forced to do so. Go Jacob Zuma, go! JM Chipkin Cape Town
