Two women accused of the murder of Ezra Daniels, 7, were granted bail in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court yesterday. Pregnant Kelly Daniels and Kimberley Solomons were granted bail of R1 000 each yesterday. The other three accused – Tasliem Bianchi, Ikeraam Bianchi and Marlon Neehuis – abandoned their bail application last week. They will remain in custody at Pollsmoor Prison until their next court appearance on December 13. Hyde Park Primary pupil Ezra was playing outside when he was caught in crossfire and shot in the neck in September. He died at the scene. His murder was met with outrage from the Parkwood community, who hadn’t want the alleged killers to be granted bail. The day Daniels was killed, the community rioted, damaging two police vehicles and injuring two police officers at the scene.
