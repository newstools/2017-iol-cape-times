CAPE TOWN - Pole dance/fitness students and instructors from across the country will showcase their silky skills in front of judges and audiences at the third annual Pole Factor Competition on Saturday, December 2. Thrilled at the sport’s recent certification as an official sport globally (with observer status along with arm-wrestling and dodgeball), The Pole Project Studio’s Kathy Lee, said: “So from an organisational perspective we are ready to rock. The surprise element comes on the day as our finalists’ routines and costumes are kept secret until their big reveal on stage. “It gets progressively harder to pick absolute winners, because the quality and effort of the performances get so much better each year.”   The competition’s format, which celebrate the athleticism and artistry of pole dance across four very different genres of the sport - Pole Acrobat, Pole Artiste, Pole Provocateur and Pole Duets - remain the same as in previous years, Lee said. Entries opened earlier this year and there are 20 finalists, but only eight will win the amateur and professional categories titles of the competition. Judges on the panel will include two of the industry’s very inspirational women, Benita Bouwer, who owns Pole Physiques studio in Johannesburg, and Tracey Ecclestone, the owner of WA Aerial Fitness in Western Australia, said Lee. Bouwer is International Pole Sports Federation (IPSF) 2017 Female Athlete of the Year and 2017 world record holder in the Masters 40+ division and Ecclestone author of the Pole & Lyra Handbook 101
