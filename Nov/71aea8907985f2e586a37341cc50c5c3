Former Zimbabwe finance minister
Ignatius Chombo, who was among those detained by the military
when they seized power before Robert Mugabe resigned this week,
appeared in court on Saturday to face corruption charges, his
lawyer said. Chombo was admitted to hospital on Friday with injuries
sustained from beatings he received in military custody, his
lawyer Lovemore Madhuku says.  Madhuku said Chombo had injuries to his hands, legs and back and was blindfolded throughout his week in custody. He was being accused of corruption and abuse of power relating to his time as local government minister more than a decade ago, Madhuku added. "It was a very brutal and draconian way of dealing with opponents," he told Reuters. Reuters
