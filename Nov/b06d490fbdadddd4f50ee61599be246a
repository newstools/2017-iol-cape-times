An urgent application by the CTMA last week against the City, their rival the Kaapse Klopse Karnival Association (KKKA) and SAPS was heard this week by Judge Robert Henney. Yesterday, Judge Henney said the applicants were given a detailed explanation by the City in September why their application to host the events was unsuccessful. “There was sufficient time for the complainant to challenge the decision at an earlier stage. "Their arguments - by extracts from a news article - to draw certain conclusions were unconvincing and therefore rejected by the court, and therefore their application was struck (from) the court roll with costs,” said Henney. KKKA director Muneeb Gambeno questioned why the CTMA was proceeding with its challenge. “There had been a regression in the Klopse culture and we are in the process of changing that perception of the Klopse - but there is an attempt to monopolise events. "We do remain open to everyone willing to join us, and we welcome the CTMA but not on an administrative level,” said Gambeno. CTMA chief executive Kevin Momberg said: “Our application was not to have the matter heard but to set a date to argue the merits of our case. "We are fighting for an event that has cultural significance and is our heritage that this smaller organisation has changed, without properly consulting us or involving us." He said that there was a bias and spite as their troupes were involved in ANC events and that the KKKA was being funded and driven by the City.
