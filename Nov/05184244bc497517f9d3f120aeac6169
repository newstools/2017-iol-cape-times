The passenger trailer was on fire as the train was drawing into Century City Station. Two adjoining carriages were also damaged. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said the fire damaged fibre optic telecoms which in turn affected the train control centre and signals at Cape Town Station. The Southern line’s signal equipment failed as well. There was no train service between Philippi, Kapteinsklip and Chris Hani due to signal equipment failure at Philippi and trains were forced to end services at Nyanga. The affected train control telecoms impacted on yesterday’s afternoon peak hour. “Regrettably, Metrorail is unable to offer alternative transport options between Cape Town and Monte Vista and commuters are requested to make their own arrangements,”Scott said. Firefighters responded within minutes, she said, and started dousing the flames immediately after Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) switched off the overhead power. The railway infrastructure was being assessed for fire damage. “It is as yet too early to speculate on the cause of the fire. The extent, cause and cost of the damage will only be confirmed after TFR and Prasa’s loss adjusters have assessed the infrastructure and rolling stock,” said Scott. On the Monte Vista Line there was a limited service operating between Monte Vista and Bellville. Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker expressed regret that commuters again had to be inconvenienced. He warned that the loss of another three carriages exacerbated the current levels of overcrowding. Technicians were expected to work through last night to restore full mobility for today’s peak hour rail traffic.
