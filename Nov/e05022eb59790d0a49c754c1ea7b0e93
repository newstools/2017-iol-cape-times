CAPE TOWN - Laughing to ease the pain of life’s hardships is not always easy, but patrons at a comedy show that aims to raise funds for a struggling Delft orphanage are guaranteed a bag full of laughs. That’s according to Fatima Wise, co-founder of the Sharing Hope Foundation, that hosts the Hope With Laughter Comedy Show on December 8 at the Academia Theatre in Lansdowne. ‘It’s going to be a fun-filled night, with some really great comedians, such as show headliner Rob van Vuuren, host Dailan Oliver, Yaaseen Barnes, Phil de Lange and Lindy Johnson. People must support the show, because we are raising funds for a struggling orphanage,” said Wise. With tickets costing R200 each, which include a complementary hot dog and cool drink, the show's earnings is for the Delft South Youth Safety and Development Association Orphanage, which is essentially a child protection programme caring for 11 children who are mostly HIV-positive and victims of rape, abandonment or child-trafficking, added Wise. Koolsum Ismail, who in 2012 founded the orphanage after an 8-month-old baby was rescued from child traffickers at OR Tambo Airport, expressed her gratitude for the show. “I’m very overwhelmed, because it’s the first time that someone is reaching out to help us. It’s very touching for me that it is strangers who are coming to assist us. Our challenges and the children’s needs are growing daily,” she said..The Sharing Hope Foundation was started in 2015 by a group of friends who wanted to offer a lending hand to abandoned children, not only in local communities but globally. It had successfully raised funds for various charities, among which is a 2015 fund-raising dinner that raised R20 000 for the orphans of the Syrian war, said Wise. Last year it raised R27 000 for the Baphumelele Children’s Centre in Khayelitsha, she added. People interested in buying tickets can call Wise at 076 048 4389. raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
