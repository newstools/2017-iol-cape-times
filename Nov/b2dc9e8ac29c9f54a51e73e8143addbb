In what could be a first for the banking sector, Nedbank last week launched a digital-only branch in Johannesburg. It said the service will be rolled to other commuter stations across the country. The NZone, which is situated at the Sandton Gautrain station, is an experimental space where clients can engage with Nedbank in a digital environment. Clients can surf the web, play on digital platforms and be taught how to be more self-sufficient with their banking. It has an interactive wall, which includes touch screens that explain how to use digital banking channels. It also provides information on banking products and services. In addition, there’s a virtual reality area that uses “gamification” to prepare clients for the future of banking. It has a private and secure video kiosk where clients can interact with a banker remotely – Skype for banking. Clients can print certified bank statements. Another drawcard is that the branch is a free wi-fi zone where clients can transact on their own devices. Ciko Thomas, the group managing executive for retail and business banking at Nedbank, says the digital branch is designed to provide clients with a safe, convenient and cost-effective experience. “We have set ourselves the goal of offering the best banking experience for our clients across all channels, with digital at the heart of everything we do. We believe these innovations will enable us to reach that goal,” Thomas says. kabelo.khumalo@inl.co.za
