City Speaker Dirk Smit confirmed that the council unanimously resolved that the City's audit and performance committee be instructed to appoint an independent investigator to look into allegations against Ebrahim, commissioner of the Transport and Urban Development Authority, Melissa Whitehead and Craig Kesson, the executive director in the office of mayor Patricia De Lille. “The said officials will be given seven days’ notice to provide written representations to council on why they should not be placed on precautionary suspension. "After a confidential special council meeting I ruled that the agenda, and all other documentation submitted to council, be open to the public in the interest of transparency,” said Smit. The council meeting, which made the ruling, was initially held behind closed doors, with no media or members of the public present to observe deliberations. A strong metro police presence ensured that only councillors were present in the council chambers. Kesson charged that Ebrahim had failed to ensure the proper implementation of the City's contract with AEM and ICT Works, contracted to implement station management and related systems for the MyCiti bus rapid transit. This failure was tantamount to “misconduct” by Ebrahim, he said. In response, Ebrahim stated in an affidavit that a legal opinion was sought by the City's “Probity Department” and the subsequent investigation had not yet been completed. Instead, Ebrahim pointed a finger at Kesson, who he claimed was guilty of intimidation and abuse of authority. Whitehead also faces disciplinary action over her management of the City's transport directorate, more importantly tenders. De Lille said she was not afforded an opportunity to respond to the allegations made by Kesson. ANC chief whip in the city council Noluthando Makasi said: “The ANC as an official opposition in the City of Cape Town has won the battle of ensuring that all alleged officials are treated fairly.”
