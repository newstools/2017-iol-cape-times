Prisoners awaiting their court appearance at the Mitchells Plain Magistrate's Court had to be evacuated from the holding cells on Tuesday following reports of a bomb threat. The building was evacuated and closed to the public and court staff for an hour after an anonymous caller threatened to blow up the J-courtroom. Police deployed the K-9 and bomb disposal units to sweep the courtrooms for any sign of suspicious items. Court manager Yvette Ishmael said that a bomb threat was received on Tuesday morning, and the magistrate's court had to be evacuated. She declined to provide any further comment. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said at about 9.14 pm a bomb threat was received by the magistrate’s court staff. “Mitchells Plain Magistrate's Court received a threat that a bomb would explode at J-court during the day. "Our K-9  and Bomb Disposal Units were deployed after all prisoners were evacuated and the building cleared. No persons were injured and no suspicious items found. "The court resumed its duties at 10:51," he said. No persons had been arrested and police are investigating a charge of bomb threat.
