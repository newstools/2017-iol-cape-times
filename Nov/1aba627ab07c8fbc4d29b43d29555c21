You've heard of pairing wine with food, but what about men? Check out your go-to-guy to see which wine might take your fancy:     What's not to love about the reliable, boyish types (ugh, don't we all wish we could be so practical?). If this guy gets your hear racing, then a no-nonsense Pinot Grigio is right up your alley. This complementary white wine never disappoints, pairs well with almost any meal and has a light somewhat casual nature.   A complex and stoic man pairs nicely with a complex and (somewhat) stoic wine: the Cabernet Sauvignon. While many mistake this red wine for being a 'standard choice' it's actually anything buy that. Underneath the Cab Sav's unassuming exterior is quite a bit of depth.Plus, it pairs well with a good home-cooked steak, which your strong, silent type probably makes exceptionally well.
