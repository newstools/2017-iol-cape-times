Much has been said about water used by the influx of our summer visitors and tourists, and that they should  pay for the water they use while  here. I would propose an emergency tax of R100 each (about £5 or $7) for every tourist and local flying into Cape Town International Airport. Posters can be put up at the airport and are already around Cape Town, explaining to tourists and us about the dire position we are in, and that we  need their help in saving every  drop. With over, I understand, 750 000 airport arrivals over the past 12 months, this would bring in more than R75 million for new water and desalination programmes currently under way. The collection of these fees would also create a few more much needed jobs and would make us who travel  into Cape Town International  far more aware of Cape Town’s  plight. This could be brought in quickly  as it could be introduced as a by-law. Philip Engelen Roseban
