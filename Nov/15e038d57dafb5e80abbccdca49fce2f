The RCS Gugulethu Athletics Club was started in 1992. Ndzube joined in 1996, and a year later became chairperson. They had about 45 members at the time and decided to expand across Gugulethu, recruiting young athletes and female runners. In 2007, they organised their first race in a quest to keep children off the streets. The race did not have sponsors. In 2008, Retail Credit Services (RCS) joined as the main sponsor, followed by New Balance and media publications. Last year, the club had 650 members. This year, it has close to 900, including 65 juniors who participate at track and field events. Last year, the race had over 1 500 participants. Participants go through the streets of Gugulethu, past historical landmarks such as the Gugulethu Seven Tombstones, Nyanga Junction, Mzoli’s Place and Amy Biehl’s tombstone (the young American activist who was murdered). Ndzube said the athletics club is the third largest club and supports most races in the province. “The highlight of the race is seeing children lining up and getting gifts from participants. It brings you in connection with the actual township life. The goal is not that we want to make it another Soweto, we want to make it a Gugulethu. “The race is open to everyone. Some years ago we had a guy running in his bikini (underwear), he had absolute fun. That is the spirit of the race: to come and enjoy it with family and friends. "With the help of WPA (Western Province Athletics) we have set the race over Reconciliation Day - December 16." Entries are open online via www.entrytime.com  lonwabo.marele@inl.co.za
