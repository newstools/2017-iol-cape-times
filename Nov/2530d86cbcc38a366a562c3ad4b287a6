The Randburg Magistrate's Court on Tuesday sentenced the two co-accused of former deputy minister Mduduzi Manana to pay a R30 000 fine or spendÂ eight months in prison, half suspended for five years. "The offence is serious in nature," Magistrate Saras Naidoo said while handing down her sentence. Cyril Madonsela, 35, and Thulani Mdaka, 42, pleaded guilty to two counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm after they hit Mandisa Duma and Noluthando Mahlaba at Cubana restaurant in Fourways in August.

As part of the recommendations of the social worker, Madonsela and Mdaka would need to undergo anger management, decision making and substance abuse programmes.

Naidoo said a fine of R3 000 would be too lenient and wouldn't send an adequate message to the public. The sentencing comes a day after the 16 days of activism against Women and Children Abuse resumed. On Monday, the defence councils of Madonsela and Mdaka asked Naidoo for a R3 000 fine or three months' imprisonment or a R6 000 fine with a suspended sentence. African News Agency
