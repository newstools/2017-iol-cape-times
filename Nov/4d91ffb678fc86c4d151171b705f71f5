Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will return to London on Monday to lead Team South Africa at the World Rugby Council announcement of the Rugby World Cup 2023 host venue on Wednesday. Ramaphosa was at the forefront of World Cup Bid Team SA in September when it presented its case to host the 2023 tournament. The South African bid has subsequently been named as the choice of the Rugby World Cup board to host the 2023 tournament. This follows an exhaustive tendering, clarification and evaluation process. Contenders France and Ireland were rated second and third respectively. The final decision rests with 26 World Rugby Council members who collectively exercise 39 votes and among whom a simple majority is required to secure the hosting rights. The three bidding countries do not vote. Those eligible to vote in the secret ballot on Wednesday are: Australia (3 votes), England (3), New Zealand (3), Scotland (3), Wales (3), Italy (3), Argentina (3), Canada (1), Japan (2), Georgia (1), Romania (1), USA (1), Asia Rugby (2), Oceania Rugby (2), Rugby Africa (2), Rugby Americas North (2), Rugby Europe (2), Sudamerica Rugby (2). The announcement is scheduled for about 3pm on Wednesday and will be broadcast live on SuperSport (Channel 201) from 2.30pm as well as being live streamed by worldrugby.org Ramaphosa’s participation and leadership will demonstrate the government’s support. He will be accompanied by Sport and Recreation Minister Thulas Nxesi, SA Rugby president Mark Alexander and chief executive Jurie Roux. African News Agency
