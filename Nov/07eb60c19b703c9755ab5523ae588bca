Jaylin Alexander, 2, underwent surgery on Friday morning to alleviate breathing difficulties caused by the wounds to her mouth. The little girl and her friends had been playing in their yard when she was struck by a stray bullet on Thursday afternoon. Jaylin’s uncle, Shafiek Tovey, 31, was critically injured in the shoot-out on the corner of 12th Avenue and Norwood Street in Leonsdale. Tovey died on the way to hospital. Police said about 50 shell casings were found at the scene. Jaylin’s aunt, Evelyn Alexander, said the family was still reeling from the shock of the double tragedy. “We have no clue why anyone would be shooting at Shafiek,” she said. Red Cross spokesperson Dwayne Evans said Jaylin was set to have major surgery next week when doctors hope to repair the damage done to her face by the bullet. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said police were investigating a case of murder and attempted murder. Imraahn Mukaddam of the Elsies River Community Policing Forum said the situation was “unacceptable” and the warring gangs had “no conscience to shoot randomly in a built-up area” such as Leonsdale. He said the community had been held hostage by daily shoot-outs for more than a year and called for a more concerted police effort, as the gangs seemed to have an unlimited source of ammunition. Jaylin’s shooting brings to four the number of children wounded in Leonsdale since the start of the year. Weekend Argus
