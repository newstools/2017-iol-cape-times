Members of the so-called crowbar gang know your home and your schedule just as well as you do. They use this information to their advantage when they want to gain access to your home and burgle it. The festive season is a busy time for crime so people should be on high alert, security experts and police have warned. “Homeowners are advised to keep their homes secured with security gates and alarm systems,” said police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana. “Ask neighbours to watch your homes when you are going away and look out for suspicious characters.   Also refrain from leaving valuables in vehicles where criminals can see them.” Phillip Bam, from the Grassy Park Community Policing Forum, said that while everyone was letting their guard down over the festive season, criminals were on high alert. “Crime goes up during this time so it is important that everyone is very alert. Make sure all your doors are locked before you leave the house and don’t leave any valuables in your car – it will be broken into if they see something of value. Look around you at all times and make sure you are not being followed.” Sniper Security managing director Ridwaan Mathews said items like flat-screen TVs, jewellery, guns and laptops were top of criminals’ lists. “They are mindful that people have more money around this time and that people are buying new things, doing renovations and so on,” he said. “Criminals will drive through an area that is quiet, prowling for homes with easy access to the front door.” Mathews said it was important to install an alarm system. He also advised investing in a guard dog and always making sure the garage was locked. “Even when arriving home, before you get out of your car pause for a few seconds to assess your surroundings. In a case of emergency your car can become your defence. “Bright lighting is also very important for night time.”  Facebook   Twitter
