Having points on her MyCiTi card is crucial for her to commute, but for over a month she has not been able to buy credit at the MyCiTi office in Kuyasa, Khayelitsha, as the office has been vandalised by cable thieves. Bidla, 24, has to travel to other areas to do so. This is costly and sometimes she is forced to find alternative transport to get to work when she runs out of MyCiTi points. Without points on her card, she travels on credit and when she finally buys the points she is penalised R22. Bidla is unhappy that she has to foot the bill for something beyond her control, something she said the City of Cape Town should deal with. “If this was happening in affluent areas, the station would be fixed in few days. The amount of time it takes to fix the station shows how black people are taken for granted. “It is such a shame for a City that claims to care.” Another commuter, Phindile Langa, said what was frustrating was the City not responding to complaints. “Why should commuters suffer this? It is unnecessary for something that has nothing to do with us.” He said he could not load points on his card three 
times and was penalised every time. The City did respond by the time of publication.
