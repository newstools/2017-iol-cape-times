The Hawks received a tip-off and found the drugs in two vehicles on the official’s property. Hawks spokesperson Lloyd Ramovha said Hawks members descended on the official’s home on Inspan Road. “A search and seizure operation resulted in the discovery of over 40 000 mandrax tablets that were hidden in the suspect’s vehicle. The drugs were valued at just under R2m,” Ramovha said. The suspect is expected to appear before the Bellville Magistrate’s Court today on charges of possession and drug dealing. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said the City was shocked by the incident and would institute pre-suspension procedures. Smith said the officer, who was off-duty at the time of his arrest, was also in possession of his official firearm “which in itself was a breach of protocols”. “While the case is still under investigation, this is of grave concern and we will assist the Hawks where required,” said Smith. He said incidents like this “have the potential to do great harm to the reputation of the City’s enforcement agencies and hundreds of officers 
who sacrificed a lot every day to help make Cape Town a safe place”. In an unrelated incident, officers from Operation Combat, the Western Cape’s gangsterism and drugs police unit, searched a house known for selling drugs in Turksvy Road, Lentegeur, on Tuesday and confiscated 145 packets of tik, 10 mandrax tablets and dagga with an estimated street value of R33 600. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a 48-year-old female was arrested and expected to appear in the Mitchells Plain Magistrate’s Court once charged.  sandiso.phaliso@inl.co.za
