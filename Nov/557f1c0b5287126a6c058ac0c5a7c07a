Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane said on Monday he was concerned about the "prolonged legal uncertainty" over the country's contentious mining charter. The Pretoria High Court on Friday postponed a hearing on the charter to 19-21 February, 2018 from 13-14 December, 2017 at the request of the Chamber of Mines, which represents producers. "The prolonged legal uncertainty caused by the postponement is indeed regrettable, especially in as far as the implementation of our transformation objectives as government is concerned," Zwane said. "We will, however, abide by the granting of the postponement." The Chamber of Mines isÂ challenging the implementation of the Mining Charter which was gazetted in June, arguing it would harm the industry and the overall economy. The charter sets new black ownership targets for the industry, including a stipulation that new mining rights holders have 30 percent black ownership shared among employees, communities and black entrepreneurs.
