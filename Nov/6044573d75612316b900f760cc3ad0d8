Abrahams returned to the witness stand yesterday in the case against Rohde, who is accused of murdering his wife and staging her suicide during a conference last year. Abrahams said: “A pathologist should remain impartial and objective. It raises serious concerns with me when a pathologist is hired by a (paying) client to conduct a second autopsy.” Defence lawyer Graham van der Spuy, who conducted the cross-examination, said her opinion was “outrageous”. Tensions ran high when Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe put it to the defence that during Van der Spuy’s cross-examination, he was “leading evidence”. State prosecutor Louis van Niekerk objected to the reference to the case of Steve Biko, where an independent forensic pathologist was consulted for a second autopsy. Van der Spuy was part of the junior counsel during the Biko case. “Justice would not have prevailed if a private pathologist did not get involved,” Van der Spuy said, before Van Niekerk objected and asked the defence to “adjudicate on the facts of this matter”. Judge Salie-Hlophe then immediately halted proceedings requesting to see all court delegates in the chambers. After the tea break Van der Spuy returned to his cross-examination and put it to Abrahams that she “did not like the autopsy, conducted by (forensic pathologist Akmal) Coetzee-Khan under your supervision, to be challenged”. Abrahams previously testified she concurred with Coetzee-Khan’s findings that cause of death of Jason Rohde’s wife, Susan, was “consistent with manual strangulation and external airway obstruction”. The case continues today in the Western Cape High Court.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
