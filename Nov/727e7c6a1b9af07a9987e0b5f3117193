Journalist and celebrated author Jacques Pauw on Thursday said President Jacob Zuma has destroyed the law enforcement agencies in South Africa, and as a result diminished the nation's capability to tackle organised crime which was thriving. "Nobody gets charged, if you think about it – I'm the one going to be charged. If you think about the massive evidence, the body of evidence in the Gupta emails for example, there is prima facie evidence of money laundering, fraud and corruption, but nothing is happening," Pauw said at the Pretoria launch of his book. "Nothing is happening because Jacob Zuma has destroyed the law enforcement agencies, in order to protect himself, his family and friends. So nothing happens." The investigative journalist said organised crime was heightened in South Africa because of the apparent lack of consequences. "There is no consequence. There is absolutely no consequences. Can you think of a major crime syndicate that was recently busted? The crime intelligence [unit of the South African Police Service] is in a shambles," said Pauw. The author said he was not afraid of being arrested in the wake of ongoing police investigations around the possible leaking of classified information contained in his book, “The President’s Keepers – Those keeping Zuma in power and out of prison”. “The State Security Agency said they have laid charges against me. The Hawks [Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation] says it’s not a charge, it’s only a complaint. "I don’t believe either of them. We are consulting a senior counsel tomorrow [on Friday], and we will prepare an application for bail if I get arrested,” said Pauw. “We don’t know, anything can happen.” African News Agency
