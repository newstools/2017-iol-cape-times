A yacht participating in the Clipper Round the World Race ran aground at Olifantsbospunt off Cape Point on Tuesday night. The Greenings team alerted rescue teams after 10pm. National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) station commander Ian Klopper said the duty crew was activated at 10.34pm. “The NSRI Kommetjie duty crew were activated after a yacht run aground at Olifantsbospunt, Cape Point, with 18 crew on board. "The Clipper Round the World Race yacht CV24 (Team Greenings) requested assistance, reporting her crew were in no imminent danger,” Klopper said. The Clipper Round the World Race yachts had left Cape Town earlier in the day on leg three of the race. “The Clipper Round the World Race yacht CV21 reported to be in the vicinity and reported to be planning to attempt a rescue operation, but we ordered the yacht to stand off, despite their good intentions, and to continue sailing. "On arrival on the scene, all casualty crew on board were in life jackets,” he said. Klopper said an NSRI Kommetjie rescue swimmer swam to the yacht through the surf and boarded it to assess the casualty crew medically and to assess the damage to the yacht. “All casualty crew were safe. We looked at the option to pull the yacht off the rocks, but it was decided instead to put all casualty crew into their two life rafts.” The operation was completed after 3am. Clipper Round the World blogsite confirmed that “Greenings Skipper Andy Woodruff and crew are doing well.”
