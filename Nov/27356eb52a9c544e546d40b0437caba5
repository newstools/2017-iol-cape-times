The State in the case against former deputy minister of higher education Mduduzi Manana on Wednesday argued in the Randburg Magistrate's Court that a fine alone would be a "slap on the wrist" for his actions. Prosecutor Anne-Marie Smith told the court that Manana had "fat" pockets and handing him a mere fine would not be adequate punishment, in addition to him having previous convictions. Earlier, the court heard that Manana hand two previous convictions of theft in 2004 and 2005.

The charges relate to the assault of three women at Cubana in Fourways on August 6. Smith submitted damage claims from the women which added up to around R27 000. Earlier damages were said to be R37 000, while Mandisa Duma, Noluthando Mahlaba and Thina Mopipa told the social worker that they wanted R100 000 compensation. As part of the claims, the trio listed the damage to their nails, hair extensions and medical fees. Smith said a strong message needed to be sent that abuse against women would not go unpunished. While submitting his arguments for Manana, Michael Motswaneng Bill told the court that being called "stabane" – a derogatory term for a homosexual person – had made gay men less free to love who they wanted to love and had oppressed them. He said the term was also derogatory for a "straight" man. He added that the injuries that were sustained by the women were bad but not as bad as they could have been. Motswaneng Bill said Manana was willing to compensate the women, do 500 hours of community service while being monitored by the social worker, and 12 months wholly suspended imprisonment over fives years, on condition that he does not commit a similar offence. Judgment has been reserved to Monday. African News Agency
