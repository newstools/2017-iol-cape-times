Cape Town is geared to root for one of its own – 17-year-old Bishop Lavis singing sensation Paxton Fielies – to win the coveted Idols SA 2017. With the distinction of being the youngest Idols 2017 contestant, Fielies is the last Capetonian in the competition, which starts at 5pm tonight on SABC’s Mzantzi’s Magic Channel 161. As the presenter of the much-loved popular TV show tonight poses the question to an excited studio audience – and millions of South African viewers – of “who will have your vote to battle it out for the ultimate prize”, there’s little doubt Capetonians will be shouting the sensational Paxton’s name in thunderous fashion.. And to give an emphatic display – Cape Town style – of where their loyalty to the sons and daughters of Table Mountain and the rugged, lively Cape Flats lie, locals are urged in their excitement not to forget to pick up the phone and vote for the petite Paxton. Earlier former Idols contestant Kyle Deutsch from the Cape advised Paxton and others who had made it through the early stages of the competition not to change their styles, according to an Independent Media correspondent.  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
