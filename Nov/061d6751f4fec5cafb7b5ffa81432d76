Relatives, friends and colleagues of murdered Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) head of residences Siyabulela Thwalani will “celebrate the life that was dedicated to the people” during two memorial services on Thursday. The services will be held at CPUT’s Bellville campus and at the OR Tambo (Mew Way) Hall in Khayelitsha. Thwalani, CPUT’s head of residences at the Cape Town campus, was ambushed in what his union, the National Education Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu), denounced as a "ghastly orchestrated hit"" on Saturday. He was in his car outside his friend's house in Khayelitsha when he was shot twice, in the face and head. On Wednesday, police said detectives were following up on all possible leads but, at this stage there were no new developments. Thwalani’s nephew, Thanduxolo Sithekele, told the Cape Times that one of his uncle’s three children was receiving counselling. “We will attend both memorial services.  We have received a lot  of support from everywhere. The work that he did is evident. The entire family is still shocked by this incident, especially the old man,”  said Sithekele. They were  supposed to receive a report from the police on Wednesday. CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley said: “There has been an outpouring of grief from within the CPUT community following Mr Thwalani’s murder. "For that reason we will be hosting a memorial service tomorrow to allow our own staff and students who knew him to share their grief, personal stories and meet his family.
