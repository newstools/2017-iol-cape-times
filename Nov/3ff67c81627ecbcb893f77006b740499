The African Union Commission (AUC) has welcomed Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe’s decision to resign, while acknowledging him as a “fearless liberation fighter”. Chairperson of the AUC Moussa Faki Mahamat said Mugabe would be remembered as a fearless pan-Africanist who had dedicated a lifetime of service to Zimbabwe as the father of the nation’s independence. “Today’s decision will go down in history as an act of statesmanship that can only bolster Mugabe’s political legacy,” said Mahamat, referring to the 93-year-old president’s Tuesday decision to finally give up the fight after Zimbabwe’s military, many members of the ruling Zanu-PF party, political opponents and many Zimbabweans had for days repeatedly called for him to step down. “The African Union recognises that the Zimbabwean people have expressed their will that there should be a peaceful transfer of power in a manner that secures the democratic future of their country,” said the AUC statement. Mugabe’s decision to resign paves the way for a transition process, owned and led by the sovereign people of Zimbabwe, added the AUC chairman. “Throughout the years, the people of Zimbabwe have demonstrated remarkable resilience and resourcefulness, and commitment to their country,” added Mahamat’s statement. “The chairperson of the commission is confident that they, together with all their leaders, will remain steadfast in their commitment to fulfill their legitimate aspirations.” The African Union looks forward to Zimbabwe continuing to play a leading role in the affairs of the African continent, as a democratic and prosperous state meeting the aspirations of its people, concluded Mahamat.
