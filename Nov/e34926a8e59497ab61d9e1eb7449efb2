The Western Cape Department of Social Development has prioritised the development and protection of the province’s 1 739 425 children. Our Children and Families programme receives R651.5 million, which is the second-largest funding allocation. The province is estimated to have about 570 000 children aged from nought to four years, who would make up the Early Childhood Development population. There are more than 2 099 registered ECD centres which receive funding from the department’s overall ECD budget of R314.4m. The budget also allows the department to identify and register the estimated 1 889 unregistered ECD centres across the province. Registration ensures their compliance with health and safety requirements, as per the Children’s Act. In addition to early childhood development, the Children’s Programme has focused on the following interventions in responding to the needs of the community: – Finalised the policy on Temporary Safe Care (a service for children- at-risk). – Finalised the Provincial Child Protection Strategy. – Developed a training package  and tools for quality assurance at  Child and Youth Care Centres to  ensure compliance to norms and standards, and this has been successfully piloted at four of our care centres. – Through our designation of  child protection organisations, the Western Cape was the first province to register the care centres for a further five years. – Implemented a provincial strategy to manage the foster care backlog, reducing it by 140 cases, a 70% reduction since the beginning of  the year. If we are truly to ensure every child is protected and raised in an enabling environment, then the government, civil society and parents need to work in partnership. We can honour our children on National Children’s Day, and every day, if we work “Better Together”. Albert Fritz MEC for Social Development
