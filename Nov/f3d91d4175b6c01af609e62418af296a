Caitlin Hanley, of Red Hot Events, says: “The idea of River Republic is to keep it small so we cap it at 800 people. This year we have made a bit more space for a vendor and food court area and a pop-up gin bar. "There’s going to be lots of fun things happening - like a ‘Mexican madness special’ during Los Tacos’s performance and smaller elements throughout the weekend, such as live comedy with Anne Hirsch as the MC and a ‘wake up, shake up’ dance, movement and expression session in the morning before heading on to the main entertainment, which starts at 6pm on Friday. There will also be a pop-up coffee stand.” One act that is taking the local music scene by storm and will be performing on the main stage is the five-piece alternative/folk rock band, Brynn  It, featuring Jules Terea on vocals and rhythm guitar; David van Vuuren, front man of Southern Wild, on lead guitar and backing vocals; Hezron Chetty on violin, Alex Smillie, also from Southern Wild, on bass; and Eddy Kriel on drums. Terea says: “I started Brynn three years ago with two mates of mine writing delicate folk stuff. Later we decided to put a new band together which shaped naturally into the current line-up, which formed in January this year. Our sound is an amalgamation of rock, folk, soul and oriental. “When we first started, we played smaller venues to develop our sound. River Republic is our first proper festival as a band. Our debut album will be out in March next year.” Also on the line-up are the Nomadic Orchestra, Jackal and The Wind, The Kiffness, Brothers Remedy, Sean Koch Trio, Money for Bali and Bam Bam Brown. *  Where: Breede River (just outside Swellendam).
