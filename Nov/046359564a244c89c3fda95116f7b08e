The report contains the latest estimates of the numbers of people living with HIV, and the number of people who have access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy globally, as well as in South Africa. UNAids executive director Michel Sidibe said South Africa had the largest Aids epidemic in the world. Young people were particularly vulnerable to being infected with HIV. There had been an estimated 610 000 new infections since March last year and March this year among young people between the ages of 15 to 24 years in the southern Africa region, with women accounting for 59% of those. He said the report found that there were 4.2 million South Africans on treatment, 200 000 new infections annually and about 17 million people who were infected but not on treatment. Infected men were not accessing treatment - in southern African about 80% of infected men were likely to die. “It is not about pills and treatment, but the quality of life one is living,” said Sidibe. The report, he added, contained a series of stories highlighting the importance of the right to health and what it meant to people from various communities. Cindy Mguye, who represented various organisations advocating for health rights, yesterday said stigma and intolerance made people reluctant to get tested for HIV, and those infected reluctant to seek treatment. “Discrimination has not been rooted out,” she said. “What we need from our communities and families is for them to love us. We are not what happened to us, but we are what we want to achieve.” Sidibe also announced the appointment of  Associate Scientific Director of the Centre for the Aids Programme of Research in South Africa, Professor Quarraisha Abdool Karim, as UNAids Special Ambassador for Adolescents and HIV.
