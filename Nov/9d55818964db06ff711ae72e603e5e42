Paxton, of Bishop Lavis, teamed up with former Idols contestant Kyle Deutsch for yesterday’s performance, singing Stay by Rihanna. Deutsch was a season 11 Idols SA finalist and is known for hits such as Back to the Beach, collaborating with a season seven and eight finalist, Shekinah. Paxton is the youngest contestant in the singing show and was the first Cape Town contestant who got a golden ticket at the Cape Town auditions earlier this year, when she sang Tori Kelly’s Confetti. Phindy Dube and Mthokozisi Ndaba, both from Durban, and Botlhale Phora, of Pretoria, were in the running. Dube did not make it to the top three. Speaking to Independent Media before the show started, Deutsch said Paxton was his favourite Idols contestant. “Paxton will definitely remain in the competition She has done very well. I also look forward to her performance. She is a good singer. "I am also rooting for the two Durban contestants, Phindy and Mthokozisi. They deserve a top three spot,” said Deutsch, who also hails from Durban. “This is the most critical stage of the competition, contestants must stick to who they are. They must not change their style because they are nearing the end - they must stick to their formula.” Through a voting process, the public decides who the ultimate winner will be. Last week when Paxton performed Listen by Beyoncé and Just the Way You Are by Bruno Mars, judge Randall Abrahams told her: “I think you’re the only girl who can go up against these guys.” In a video created for the Idols SA website, contestants interviewed one another and when asked by Phora if duets were a “yay or nay” for her, Paxton said: “It’s a yay, because then I’m not alone on stage.” After being asked who she would choose as an opening act of her own concert, Paxton laughed after she said: “I think I’d have Drake as an opening act, if I’d make it that huge.” To vote for Paxton, SMS 08 to 37400 or vote for free on the Mzansi Magic website.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
