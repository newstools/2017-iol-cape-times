CAPE TOWN - On the final day of cross-examination of Susan Rohde's psychologist, Jane Newcombe maintained her patient did not display "suicidal tendencies". Susan’s psychological state has come under scrutiny in the Western Cape High Court, where her husband, Jason Rohde, is standing trial for her alleged murder.
With new evidence submitted by the defence, images downloaded from the deceased's phone was shown to Newcombe. 
​In one image referred to, ​the quote read: "You go home and you cry and you want to die." Mihalik asked if Newcombe knew that Susan was downloading images which were "suicide related". 
Newcombe said this was never mentioned to her. 
"(The image talks of) the intensity of her emotion. It is an expression and not necessarily a suicidal statement," Newcombe said. Defence lawyer Pete Mihalik also questioned Newcombe if she knew of the "incessant messaging" from Susan to Jason. 
Newcombe said: "I did not know of the incessant messaging, but she did tell me that she was checking (Jason's) phone." The State alleges Susan was killed by manual strangulation, and possibly including violence inflicted by means unknown. In his plea explanation, Jason admitted to an extramarital affair with a Cape Town-based colleague.
Jason, who is currently out on R1.1 million bail, pleaded not guilty to killing his wife during a company annual conference on July 24 last year and defeating the ends of justice by staging a suicide. Jason said he found his wife dead in the bathroom of their room at the luxury hotel at the Spier Wine Estate where the conference was held. 
Susan’s death was initially thought to be a suicide and an inquest docket was opened, until a post-mortem indicated foul play might have been involved. Newcombe said Susan asked Jason to accompany him to the conference, but “she felt she would know for sure if she saw them together”. Cape Times
