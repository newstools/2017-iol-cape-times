Once again Professor Tim Noakes is having to endure, and defend himself against, blatant professional jealousy, along with the arrogance of academia screaming its chagrin at his success. What is it with them? Professor Noakes’s work has scientifically shown the error in traditional thinking on nutrition and has ruffled many feathers, hence the overreaction and drawn-out disciplinary inquiry which eventually, and justly, cleared his name. Sadly, what is good, right, logical and plain common sense seems unpalatable to many, despite seeing the obvious distress of those trapped in obesity and diet-related disease. Tim Noakes has taken us back to the family dinner table to communicate and find balance in our lives and in our eating habits. His work has challenged our conscience (and laziness) and exposed our craving for carbohydrates, as well as our addiction to sugar (the sustenance of this brave new world) and thus, self. His work is a revelation about obesity, illness and despair. About correct and sensible eating habits and good health. No one is force-fed whether with food or fact. We are free to inform ourselves, think for ourselves and choose for ourselves (though we are never free from the consequences of our choices). Thank you to Professor Noakes for having our backs. Because of his liberating work, we have his. Best he leave the others to whosoever’s backs they are patting. “RES IPSA LOQUITUR” Shan Bradbury Stellenbosch
