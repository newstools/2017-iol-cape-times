There is much ado about our water crisis here in Cape Town and correctly so. However, it would be useful to get answers to three questions from our erstwhile city council: 1) Why the secrecy over commercial (including produce for export, hotels, B&Bs, etc) water users? 2) Why not reduce water pressure NOW, so that consumption (and energy use) drops immediately, extending the useful quantity of water? 3) How do you intend to monitor how much water is collected at collection points? Will each child, elderly, infirm and handicapped person have to queue for water every day? How will the city function in these circumstances? From “too little, too late” responses by the city council, to mega-projects that ordinary users will pay the most for; from “tourist” areas being prioritised over citizens to inability to crack down on borehole/wellpoint use (all are our collective resources, yes?), it has become very clear indeed – the Cape Town City Council is not only well captured too, but that it is living in denial. Wish it were not so… Muna Lakhani Wynberg
