Also in the running at the ceremony  in Johannesburg was Cape Times content producer Lisa Isaacs who won the Western Cape Vodacom Journalist of the Year Award in the print category. Said Jikelo: “I really feel great about this award. This wouldn’t have been possible without the support of my Cape times colleagues. Thanks to Ms Virrooi for allowing me to tell her story. I hope things could  change for the better for her. “This gives me courage to tell stories of our  marginalised people.We have a huge role to play. I hope this will inspire  disadvantaged children from Khayelitsha to Manenberg.” Cape Times Editor Aneez Salie said: “Award number 8 is phenomenal for Phando, who has once more brought great honour for the Cape Times. "Once again his subject is the poor and downtrodden. This is the face of transformation at the Cape Times and Independent Media.”
