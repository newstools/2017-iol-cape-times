These were the words of University of the Western Cape student Janine Anthony, from Delft, who was invited by the Mozilla Foundation to attend their annual Mozilla Festival in the UK last week. She runs one of the UWC Mozilla Technology Clubs at Perseverance High School in Belhar, where she teaches Grade 9 pupils about the internet and the basics of coding. “Seeing kids as young as 13 already being inventors showed me my work has just started. Our kids are not as exposed, as many schools and communities are under-resourced when it comes to technology,” said Anthony. “I want our kids to be included and grow to where the rest of the world is at.” She said there wasn’t continual learning in the subject as many children did not have laptops or internet access at home or school. “We need assistance from government to create infrastructure for community server hubs that would allow under-resourced communities internet access,” she said. “There also needs to be more technology subjects at school level and schools need technology teachers as many schools have unused computer labs.”  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
