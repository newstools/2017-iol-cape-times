The African National Congress Women's League on Monday named Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as its preferred candidate as president of the ruling party. Mpumalanga Premier and ANC provincial chairperson David “DD” Mabuza was named as the ANCWL's deputy president, current Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa as national chairperson and Free State Premier Ace Magashule as secretary-general. The ANCWL held its extended national executive committee (NEC) – which was attended by representatives from provinces and regions – on Sunday. "The meeting was convened to primarily nominate preferred ANC leadership to serve in the ANC NEC post the 54th National Conference in December 2017," the ANCWL said. "The meeting further reaffirmed the need for the fundamental changes in the structure, systems, institutions and patterns of ownership, management and control of the economy in favour of all South Africans, the majority of whom are African and female. "The ANCWL's extended NEC meeting unanimously agreed that the following comrades must be the top six of the ANC that will champion radical economic transformation to eradicate inequalities, unemployment and poverty in the country." The ANCWL named current deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte to remain in her position and current International Relations and Co-operation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane as treasurer-general. The league said that the additional members of the ANC NEC would consist of 50 percent of women. "For over 23 years, the majority have been enjoying political freedom with little or nothing to celebrate on economic freedom. "The economy is still in the hands of the minority. The leadership to be elected in the 54th ANC National Conference must be fearless and unapologetic in implementing the radical economic transformation." African News Agency
