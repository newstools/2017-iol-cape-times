The ANC on Wednesday remained mum on the court ruling in Bloemfontein in which party's planned provincial elective conference was put off until a number of branch meetings had been properly held. The court ruled that a number of branch general meetings that took place in the past couple of months were unlawful and should be held again lawfully. "In holding that the aforesaid meetings were irregular, unlawful, unconstitutional and in breach of the ANC constitution, the provincial conference of the ANC, Free State, scheduled for 1 to 3 December 2017, will be a nullity and is not be held until the aforesaid meetings have been held in a lawful manner and in accordance with the constitution of the ANC," the judgment read.  Read: Court rules that some #ANCFreeState BGMs were unlawful, halts conference However, the ANC was unwilling to comment.
