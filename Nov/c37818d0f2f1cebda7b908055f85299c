The SABC head of legal services, Sizwe Vilakazi, has been shot dead in suspicious circumstances. "It is with great sadness to announce the passing of Mr Sizwe Vilakazi, the SABC’s head of legal services. Mr Vilakazi was shot dead last night (Saturday)," SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said. The SABC board, management and staff sent heartfelt condolences to the Vilakazi family and friends. Vilakazi would be remembered for his immense contribution at the SABC. He was dedicated to his work and entrusted with a huge responsibility of heading the SABC’s legal division, Kganyago said. Vilakazi, 42, was gunned down in a suspected hit at his liquor store in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, on Saturday night after three men entered the store. Nothing was stolen and the trio thought to be behind the shooting fled the scene in a blue hatchback Polo Vivo.
 
Vilakazi had served the SABC in various capacities. He was hired as a senior legal adviser on December 1, 2008 and on September 1, 2016 was appointed head of legal services. "Mr Vilakazi was a remarkable legal mind with an exceptional intuition and work ethic. He led the corporation’s legal division with unsurpassed talent and perseverance. "He executed his duties without compromising the organisation’s core values.
 
"His meaningful contribution to the SABC will remain and continue to inspire all who knew him in his personal and professional space. "He will be deeply missed and may his soul rest in peace," Kganyago said. Details of his memorial and funeral service would be announced in due course. African News Agency
