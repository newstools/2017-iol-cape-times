The letter "Poor picked on while corrupt powerful do as they please" (Cape Times, November 7, page 8) refers. The writer makes reference to the actions of Metro Police officers in relation to illegal trading at the intersection of Newlands Avenue and Paradise Road this past Saturday. The traders in question are operating in an area where informal trading is prohibited. As they move in and around the roadway, they put their own lives at risk as well as the lives of others. They have been warned, fined and had their wares impounded on numerous occasions. In addition, the City has also offered them an alternative legal trading site which they refused. The City is a great supporter of informal trading as a crucial part of the economy and that is why we designate trading sites. The constitution provides rights to any residents to choose their trade, occupation or profession freely. The same constitution states that a municipality may administer by-laws to administrate that trade. The City does this in the form of the Informal Trading By-law, which seeks to ensure fairness and protect all concerned. Enforcement officers are compelled to police this legislation. Officers tread a fine line in this regard and their action is usually informed by complaints from members of the public. Where residents complain about trading in a particular area, for example, we must ensure that by-laws are being adhered to. We cannot enforce by-laws selectively, however trivial they may seem to some. Informal traders are encouraged to engage with the City. This is to see how the City can â€¨assist them in securing legal trading spaces and helping to grow their businesses.
