That mountain comprises the mayor of Durban and South Africa’s first lady, who are rallying behind Ndaba to win season 13 of Idols South Africa, according to a recent report from a Durban newspaper that would be delighted to see Ndaba take the win. Which is why Capetonians who want to see Cape Flats teenager Fielies walk away with the top prize this weekend have to put shoulder to the wheel to help hoist her over that mountain and to the finish line by SMSing 08 to 37400. Fielies and Ndaba recently spent a week in London recording their two separate debut singles, respectively titled Demonstrate and Masithande (Let’s love each other), according to the newspaper report. It also highlights that a Durban businessman and supporters of Ndaba had bought R11 500 worth of airtime to give to Durban locals to vote 
for their hometown boy, as 
well as organised motorcades to welcome him home after the final. With the Durban singer’s fanatical support behind him, Capetonians will have to pull out all the stops to ensure that talented teen Fielies emerges as winner of the 13th season of Idols SA
