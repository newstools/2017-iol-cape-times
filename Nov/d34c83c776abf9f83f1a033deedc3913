Parliament announced on Monday that the inquiry into the mismanagement of funds at state power utility Eskom will not sit this week. In a statement, Parliament said the portfolio committee on public enterprises will not meet this week to conduct its inquiry on Eskom into the mismanagement of state funds in state-owned enterprises. The committee is set to meet on Wednesday to deliberate on the work that the inquiry has conducted.
 
The committee has made an application to hear witnesses on the week of 5 to 8 December, the statement added. The committee last week heard testimony from former Eskom board chairman Zola Tsotsi, who implicated President Jacob Zuma and his ally, former South African Airways board chairwoman Dudu Myeni, in interference in affairs at the state-owned power utility. Tsotsi, tesifying in the parliamentary inquiry into allegations of state capture at Eskom, explained that following the appointment of new board members in 2015, some disturbing events involving Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, Zuma, Myeni and one of the Gutpa brothers had unfolded.
