Police in Milnerton, following up on information received from the public, uncovered a drug manufacturing laboratory and arrested three people in the early hours of Sunday morning, Western Cape police said. "Milnerton police members followed up on information they received from the community about drug activities at a house in Diluta Road, Sunset Beach, Milnerton, and arrested three suspects on drug-related charges," Captain FC van Wyk said. Visible policing officers searched the premises about 10 minutes after midnight and found four mandrax tablets, three ecstasy tablets and a small quantity of magic mushrooms. During a further search of the premises, a "clandestine laboratory with different chemicals and drugs was found in one of the rooms". Three suspects, aged 22, 38, and 53, were arrested. The estimated street value of the drugs seized was still to be determined. The suspects will appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. Partnership policing with the community was the key to creating safer and drug-free communities, Van Wyk said. African News Agency
