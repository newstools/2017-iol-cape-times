But while the rain has had a minor impact on water levels, residents have again been asked to cut down their usage as a hot summer sets in. As of yesterday, rains in George had increased dam levels to 68%. In the Hessequa region, no damage was reported as a result of stormy weather. A total of 56mm of rainfall was recorded in Riversdale, and 63mm in the Korentepoort Dam area. Total rainfall in the Bitou municipality was 55.5mm. Roodefontein dam levels are at 66.4% Both the Swartvlei and Touws River estuaries were breached subsequent to the rainfall. Garden Route National Park manager Paddy Gordon expressed relief that breaching was closely aligned to the park’s management plan. Swartvlei was ranked number 7 in South Africa by independent researchers for its biological diversity. “Managing the system is complex but water measured yesterday facilitated the decision made to breach/open both the Swartvlei and Touws River mouths,” he said. SANParks said residents from Sedgefield came out in their numbers to witness the breaching of the Swartvei estuary. Channels were reportedly prepared days before and machinery was on standby. James-Brent Styan, spokesperson for Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell, said: “We are happy with this early summer rain. This is unseasonal rainfall and it is further proof that climate change is real.” While he said it was too early to say if the rain had made any difference, the rainfall would add to groundwater reserves, and possibly lessen the risk of veld fires. “The Eden District, particularly the Bitou and Knysna areas, is the worst affected by the drought. Rain in these areas is welcome. “But the drought is not over. People need to continue to use as little water as possible,” Styan said.
