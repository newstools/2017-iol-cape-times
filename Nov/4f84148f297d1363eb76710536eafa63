Three people appeared in the Bellville Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Friday on charges of prepaid electricity fraud amounting to almost R600 000, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (better known as the Hawks) said. Spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said the couple, 35-year-old Butch and 38-year-old Francisca Green, made a brief appearance in court with Johannes Williams, 57. "For a period of a year, starting in January 2015, it is alleged that the accused, who worked at the Drakenstein Municipality in Paarl, allegedly sold pre-paid electricity for cash to the public at a cheaper rate," Ramovha said. "In the same period they allegedly colluded and produced illegal replacement prepaid electricity tokens on the system to disguise their unlawful activities. The municipality lost approximately R600 000 as a result." Ramovha said that they were arrested by the serious commercial crimes unit on October 25. "They are expected to appear in court on December 11 to face about 1 342 counts of fraud." African News Agency
