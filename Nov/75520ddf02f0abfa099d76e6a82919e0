The DA has slammed the actions on a council member captured in a video attacking Kannaland Speaker Aletta Theron during a council meeting on Monday. The party’s eastern region leader, Jaco Londt, said Theron has registered a charge of assault against Arrie May, who he said was a member of  the Independent Civic Organisation of South Africa (Icosa).

"Despite constant attacks, working under tremendous pressure, DA Speaker Aletta Theron said she would ‘fight until the end because I can see now that I’m obviously doing a good job’,” said Londt. But Icosa provincial leader Dawid Kamfer said May belonged to their party and called on the council to take action against him. “As I said we cannot allow things like that to happen in any council. We are against that and the council must take the necessary steps against this individual. "We cannot say what he did was right. It’s wrong and it cannot be allowed. It can happen even if Icosa is in charge. It very dangerous,” he said.
