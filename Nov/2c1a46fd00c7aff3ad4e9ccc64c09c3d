Police are investigating the mysterious deaths of two police officers who were found shot dead at their home in Delft. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the husband and wife, both 38 years old, were found in their Delft Gateway residence yesterday morning. “The circumstances surrounding an apparent murder and suicide of a married SAPS couple, both aged 38, are under investigation after their bodies were discovered in their Delft N2 Gateway residence this morning. "Both held the rank of constable and were stationed at Cape Town Central and Durbanville respectively,” Van Wyk said. Delft CPF cluster deputy chairperson Julian Unthank said they were aware of the incident but did not have much information as “details were being kept very quiet”. According to an anonymous source, neighbour accounts of the event detailed the husband shot and killed his wife before committing suicide. “According to the neighbours, the husband came home at about 1am (yesterday) morning and there was loud music playing. "At about 9.30am members of Durbanville SAPS came to the member’s house to look for him as he had to report for duty at 6am. “They forced the doors open. The police vehicle driven by the deceased was still standing outside. They came across the bodies. "The wife was issued with a 108 firearm. It is unknown at this stage as to who was shot first.” According to the source, it seems as if an argument occurred between the couple “as a bag was found in front of the cupboard with clothing belonging to the husband”.
