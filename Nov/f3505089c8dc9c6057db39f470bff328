With reference to your edition on Tuesday, November 7 – “Finance committee wants disciplinary action details”. It is about time that the standing committees in Parliament demand to have full details of forthcoming disciplinary hearings in many of the cases that are pending. Unfortunately, our government has become infamous for suspending its employees for wrongdoing and then taking no action. These employees are kept on full salary sometimes even with bonuses and increases while waiting for disciplinary hearings many months in the future. Over and above this, when disciplinary hearings do take place, it appears the actual facts of the hearing are kept away from the portfolio committees and standing committees of Parliament. It is in the public’s interest to know exactly what has transpired with regard to the various allegations of wrongdoing. After all, it is the public who are paying the salaries of many of the recalcitrant employees. Michael Bagraim, MP Labour spokesperson
