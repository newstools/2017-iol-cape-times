The management of Table Mountain National Park (TMNP) would like to inform its day visitors that water-saving measures have been implemented, especially in picnic areas such as Bordtjiesdrift and Buffels Bay in Cape Point, Boulders as well as at  some of the other picnic sites, which include Tokai, Silvermine  and Oudekraal. Some of the measures are: – Waterless hand sanitation products, especially in the toilet facilities in Cape Point. This was made possible with the assistance of Thebe Tourism who manages the Two Ocean Restaurant and the funicular. – A reduction in the number of outdoor taps at picnic sites. – The immediate closure of all outdoor shower facilities at picnic sites and coastal beaches. – Visitors, particularly those using the picnic sites, are encouraged to bring water from home. – We encourage picnic-site users, especially those wishing to braai, to ensure that they don’t leave fires unattended and they put their fires out once they have finished braaiing. – Park users are encouraged to report leaking taps, pipes and so on to the closest TMNP office. The park will continue to monitor the situation with regard to the water crisis and take the necessary measures. Merle Collins SANParks
