The Hawks say two brothers implicated in the murder of Brian Wainstein have been arrested following swift investigations. The pair, aged 27 and 31, were arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Unit on Saturday.
 
Wainstein, a suspected international steroid dealer, was reportedly shot and killed in front of his wife and child in the early hours of August 18 at their Constantia home.
 
He was reportedly fighting extradition to the US, where he was suspected of dealing in millions of dollars worth of steroids.
 
“At the time of the incident, Wainstein’s wife explained that her husband had received a visit earlier that evening by two men requesting to speak to the deceased. "Later on she was awoken by sounds of gunshots and realised that her husband was wounded in the chest,” said Hawks spokesperson Lloyd Ramovha.
 
He said Wainstein was declared dead on the scene.
 
“The gunmen allegedly took three cellphones before they fled leaving the wife and child unharmed,” said Ramovha. He added that investigations by police led to the arrest of Fabian Cupido, 39, on October 10, for his alleged involvement in the murder. He remains in custody following a series of court appearances thus far, he is expected back in court on Wednesday. The brothers are expected to appear at the Wynberg Magistrate’s court on Monday to face a charge of murder.
