Known for the winery and a spectacular view of Table Mountain, Table Bay and Robben Island, Durbanville Hills is located 20 minutes away from the Cape Town city centre, standing proud against the Tygerberg Hills. While titled as South Africa’s Best Restaurant in Restaurant Week’s Fifth Anniversary edition, Durbanville Hills scored a score of 9.7 out of 10 for their menu and service. Restaurant manager Dirk Steyn said it was the drive and expertise of the culinary team that led the restaurant to take the title of best restaurant in the whole country for 2017. “The team is thrilled to have been recognised by such a prestigious competition, especially as it’s based on actual consumer feedback. “As per usual, the restaurant’s goal is to deliver an innovative menu using fresh and local ingredients coupled with exquisite service delivery. "Overall, the restaurant received exceptionally high scores including 9.8 for cuisine, 10 for service and 9.5 for ambiance. “These awards would not be possible without (the staff’s) diligence and continuous determination,” said Steyn. Based on consumer reviews, Durbanville Hills was selected to participate in an extension of Restaurant Week, taking place from November 23 to December 5, as one of the top 10 restaurants of the Western Cape region. “So if you didn’t get to try the menu before, now is your chance. Bookings are now open via www.restaurantweek.co.za,” said Steyn. Head chef at Durbanville Hills, Louisa Greef, celebrated the achievement by sharing the recipe for her famous seared salmon with onion spread, lemon béarnaise and brown rice puffs, “a fan favourite 
during Restaurant Week”.
