Three SANDF members have been arrested with a vehicle police presumed was stolen in Mfuleni on Thursday, police said. “On Thursday, 2 November, 2017 at approximately 12:00, the SAPS National Intervention Unit members were patrolling in Mfuleni when they heard on the radio that there was a vehicle that is being monitored by Crime Intelligence and that had been taken in Delft. "The members spotted the vehicle in the Mfuleni Main Road. They pulled over the vehicle, which fitted the description. When they tested the vehicle, it was discovered that it had false number plates. "The occupants of the vehicle, two men and a woman, were arrested,” said police spokesperson FC van Wyk. The vehicle had been taken from Delft on October 24. “The victim had just arrived home with his car and was busy closing the gate when three unknown males forced their way into the yard. "One of the suspects had a firearm and they went into the house and took clothing, a cellphone and vehicle keys before they drove off with the victim's company vehicle,” said Van Wyk. He said the suspects were wearing army uniforms and the woman was dressed in civilian clothing during the arrest. “They confirmed that they all worked for the army and they were between the ages of 30 and 47 years. The one carries the rank of corporal and the two others, the rank of fireman in the Army,” he said. The three will appear at Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court on Monday on charges of possession of a presumably stolen vehicle.
