The protests began over two weeks ago by groups consisting of indigenous Khoi organisations and Garlandale residents. Ancestral Burial Ground Steering Committee member, Chief Basil Coetzee, said that the fencing had been reinforced with barbed wire and security guards with dogs brought in. “There was a notice for an interdict by the (Anglican) church against us, but this has now been withdrawn. We have now also turned to the legal system to seek an interdict against them to halt the exhumations and for the church to reinstate the public participation process,” said Coetzee. He said reports by the church of violence and intimidation by protesters were false; but, if true, barbed wire and dogs would not stop them. Coetzee said he feared the legal processes tended to favour those with power and resources. The Anglican church began the process earlier this year and the exhumed remains would be reburied in a columbarium, a sealed church-like building alongside St Mark’s Church in Athlone. Garlandale resident, Caroline Jamal, 38, said she represented the residents of the area, some of whom had regularly visited their deceased loved ones at the site. “I live across from the cemetery and I can tell you the entire process was flawed and has to be restarted. Our ward councillor told us to wait for the rezoning process but by then it would be far too late. Black River burial ground was the last site that held this historical name,” said Jamal. In a previous interview with the Cape Times,  Reverend Karl Groepe said the Anglican church was concerned following reports from the archaeologist of the project of intimidation and threats of violence from protesters at the site. He said all the relevant legal processes and consultative processes were followed prior to starting exhumations, at great cost to the Anglican Diocese. The Cape Times was unable to get further  comment at the time of publication.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
