Harare - The leader of Zimbabwe's war
veterans Chris Mutsvangwa said on Monday he would initiate court
action to legalise the military action against President Robert
Mugabe after the army seized power on Wednesday. The 93-year-old president defied expectations that he would
resign in a national address on Sunday night during which he was
flanked by military generals. Mutsvangwa called for less restrained protests than those staged at the weekend in an effort to dislodge Mugabe. "Save the country further turmoil. If not, we are bringing the people of Zimbabwe back to the streets," he said Monday, as he also threatened legal action against the president. "This time there will be a sit-in. We are not going to be leaving Harare until this guy is gone. "He's lost his marbles."
