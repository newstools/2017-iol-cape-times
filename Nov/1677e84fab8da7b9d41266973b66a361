The police said the arrests formed part of Operation Combat, which they said was centred on cutting off the supply of firearms and drugs. Police said that on Saturday at about 4pm while en route to another operation in Bishop Lavis, they obtained information about a shooting at the corner of Simonsberg and Rose Street in Bishop Lavis. They found a man with four gunshot wounds, two in the head and and two in his left arm. He died on the scene. No arrests had been made. In the same area, an unlicensed 9mm Z88 pistol, one 9mm magazine and 16,9mm live rounds were confiscated. Two arrests were made. “While the police were making their way out to their vehicle with the arrested suspects, the community and gang members started attacking the police with stones,” said police spokesperson FC Van Wyk. Three people were arrested. After Caledon police responded to a complaint about a smell coming from a building in an industrial area, they discovered 67 258 units of abalone with an estimated street value of R5 million. Two suspects aged 29 and 32 were arrested. In Delft South on Friday, “high grade dagga” with an estimated value of R25 000 and R95 890 in cash was seized.
