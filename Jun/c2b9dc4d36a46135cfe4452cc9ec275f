Judge Kate Savage is expected to hand down a sentence to convicted killer Howard Oliver. He was found guilty on four counts. He initially pleaded not guilty to three counts; a charge of murder and two counts of rape. He only pleaded guilty to a charge of aggravated robbery. Subsequent to the withdrawal of his lawyer, advocate Ken Klopper, from the matter due to ethical reasons, Oliver changed his plea. Through consultation with his newly appointed Legal Aid SA lawyer, advocate Henk Carstens, Oliver pleaded guilty to all four charges. The 16-year-old teenager’s body was found naked lying face down in the fynbos at the Tokai forest, last year, after going missing a few hours before. She had been raped and murdered. Forensics said she had died due to strangulation and throttling. She was found with many bruises to her body. In her judgment Judge Savage said: “The brutal attack perpetrated by the accused to Franziska Blochliger, a teenager deeply loved by those around her, was shocking, unprovoked and senseless. The accused senselessly robbed the deceased of her constitutional right to life. Her right to bodily integrity and her right as a child to be protected from maltreatment, abuse and degradation.” In aggravation of sentence State prosecutor Lenro Badenhorst said Oliver had 10 previous convictions including assault, robbery and drug possession. Oliver begged the court for forgiveness, but Badenhorst argued the court should not deviate from the minimum sentence. Sentencing will take place on Wednesday.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
