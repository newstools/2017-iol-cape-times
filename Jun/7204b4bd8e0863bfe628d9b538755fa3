The Kensington Community Policing Forum says the death of  an 18-month-old boy is an isolated incident as the area has not experienced such an incident before. The infant’s stepfather was  arrested in connection to his son’s death. The boy’s mother was taken for questioning on Monday night. Police police responded to a complaint at a health facility in Kensington where health workers informed officers  of an 18 month old boy who died from injuries after he was brought for medical attention. The child had sustained serious injuries to the head and body. The Kensington CPF  said the child was declared dead at the Factreton Clinic. He was brought to the clinic by the boyfriend of his mother, who was at work at the time. “The CPF conveys its condolences to the family of the little boy. At this stage, the case is being investigated and further details will emerge. We encourage the community to support the family in this time of bereavement,” the CPF said.
