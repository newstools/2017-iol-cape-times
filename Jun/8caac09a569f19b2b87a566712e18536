Cape Town – The suspects accused of murdering and raping 5-year-old Iyapha Yamile are free after the State withdrew charges against them. Thabiso Mtshanguta and Thabo Titus appeared in the Khayelitsha Magistrate's Court on Friday morning. The two men, whose shacks were demolished by angry residents, were arrested days after Iyapha’s mutilated body was found in a plastic bag on May 1. The State said after investigation, which included DNA, no evidence linked the two to the crime. National prosecuting authority Eric Ntabazalila said: “There is a male DNA that was found in the underwear and lower parts of the deceased's body but that DNA does not belong to the two accused who appeared in court. Investigation on that DNA is continuing and we hope it will point us in a direction where a suspect will be arrested and prosecuted. For now nothing links these two accused to the crime.” Iyapha had gone missing April 30 while playing outside her aunt’s house in Town Two Khayelitsha. Her body was discovered at the next morning. According to her family, Mtshanguta is the father of Iyaha’s friend she had been playing with at the time of her disappearance.
