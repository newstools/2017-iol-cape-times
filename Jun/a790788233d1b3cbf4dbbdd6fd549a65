Speaking during a briefing in Parliament on the 2015-16 municipality audit outcomes, Masondo said corruption remained one of the country's key challenges. “It will be useful to ensure that as we talk (about corruption), we actually ask: Which are the most corrupt municipalities and entities in the country? “If we do that, we force focus and concentrate our minds on those. I know it will be a difficult thing to do,” he said. The former mayor of Johannesburg made his comments when the co-operative governance and traditional affairs committee heard that there was an 86% (185 municipalities) slow response rate to the auditor-general’s message on improving key controls and risk areas.
