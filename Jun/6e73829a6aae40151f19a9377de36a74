Police have opened an investigation into corruption allegations against two of their own who allegedly framed an Uber driver &nbsp;and forcefully solicited R500 to &nbsp;avoid being arrested arrest. Burundian national Assumani Ncahuturi had finished cleaning his car in Constitution Street in the city when blue lights pulled up behind him. They told me to get out and step one metre away from my car, then they proceeded to search the car. They asked me what I am doing here and asked me to provide my ID and driver's license. I told them I am an Uber driver, they asked what is that. I told them it is a taxi company,&quot; he said. Upon searching the car, the two male officers allegedly &nbsp;presented him with a small packet of dagga, which they said they found in his car. &quot;I was completely shocked. They asked me what is this and I said I do not know, said the 42-year-old. Ncahuturi said the dagga was not his and he was sure it did not belong to a rider as he had just cleaned the car, prior to the incident.
