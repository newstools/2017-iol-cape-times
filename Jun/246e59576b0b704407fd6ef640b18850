Cape Town- The City of Cape Town advised residents on Wednesday to not use more water just because it was raining, reminding them that the use of water was still officially for essential use only. In a statement, the City said that residents were still being asked to continue using less than 100 litres per person per day and that the cold front currently sweeping across the city was not a green light “out of our drought situation”. “In order to see a real big difference, we will need at least three consecutive winters of above average rainfall,” the City said. Mayoral Committee Member for Informal Settlements, Water and Waste Services, and Energy, Xanthea Limberg said: “It must be noted that, due to climatic unpredictability, no one is able to definitely predict when our next big rainfall will occur. We must, therefore, continue to save water now and we cannot afford to have our water use influenced by the weather – using less than 100 litres per person per day whether, at home, work, school or elsewhere remains the requirement.” Provision has been made to capture excessive inflows at wastewater treatment works by redirecting it to maturation or retention ponds where available the City added. “There are critical points in the sewer reticulation system where stormwater is diverted to the sewer system. This water is treated to make more treated effluent available. An investigation is under way to see how to capture urban stormwater at a greater scale and then store it for later treatment and use,” Limberg said “The City urges consumers, where possible, to use suitable containers to capture rainwater, which is perfect for flushing toilets, as an example. Flushing an average toilet could save nine litres per flush depending on the type of toilet.” The City also moved to assure that the drinking of water was safe “as regular tests are run to make sure the high level of water quality is maintained”. – African News Agency (ANA)
