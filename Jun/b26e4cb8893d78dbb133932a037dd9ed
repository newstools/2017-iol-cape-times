Cape Town – The Van Breda family murder trial was expected to continue on Monday morning but Judge Siraj Desai entered court and announced that the case had been postponed to Wednesday June 7. The postponement arose as Henri’s lawyer Pieter Botha’s had a family emergency which needed his attention. Botha’s son is in hospital.     Judge Desai asked Advocate Matthys Combrink, Botha’s colleague,if Botha would be okay to proceed with the trial, to which Combrink replied that Botha was willing to continue and would need a couple of days to tend to the emergency. Judge Desai then conveyed the court’s wish for his son to get better, before adjourning proceedings. Warrant Officer Andre Hitchcock from the Criminal Record Centre in Worcester, previously took to the stand last Thursday detailing his involvement on the crime scene. Hitchcock is a photographer and crime scene investigator, collecting forensic samples and videos of the crime scene itself. Botha is expected to continue Hitchcock’s cross-examination when the trial resumes. Henri stands accused of the murder of his brother Rudi, father Martin, mother Teresa and the attempted murder of his sister Marli.  theolin.tembo@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
