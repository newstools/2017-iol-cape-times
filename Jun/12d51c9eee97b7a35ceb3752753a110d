The two men charged with the rape and murder of 19-year-old Sinoxolo Mafevuka were seen dragging a woman hours before the teenager s body was found in a communal toilet. State witness Xolile Matshotyana yesterday detailed before the Western Cape High Court how he had witnessed Athabile and Xolisa Mafilika dragging someone just after midnight on March 2, 2016. Matshotyana had been coming from a tavern when he heard someone screaming in between shacks at SST Block in Khayelitsha. Upon investigating, he saw Athabile wearing a hat and what appeared to be sunglasses while a second person s hands covered the woman s mouth. It was after Xolisa had spoken that Matshotyana recognised who the person was.At the time, Matshotyana had been on his way to a garage. He said some of the items found at the scene, and which form part of the evidence, had been worn by the accused. Mafevuka s mutilated body was found in a flooded toilet with her clothes scattered around the cubicle, while some of them were found in the cistern last year. The last time her family saw her was after she had finished cooking supper and went to make use of the communal toilets situated about 250 metres from where she stayed. While the two cousins, who are related to Mafevuka s boyfriend, have pleaded not guilty, the State believes they committed the crimes. Matshotyana said none of the accused had noticed him as he watched them. I saw the hands covering the mouth. Athabile was doing the dragging and it was someone else covering the mouth. I heard the voice of the second person. It was the voice of Ski (Xolisa). I know him. I did nothing and proceeded to the garage, said Matshotyana. He said he had been informed later that morning that a body had been found in the toilets and had been raped. He did not know the name of the person and did not go to the scene, he testified.
