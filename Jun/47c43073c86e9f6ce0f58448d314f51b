More than 200 youth from around the country were treated with trips to iconic sites, such the District Six Museum and Pollsmoor Correctional Services, as part of Youth Month celebrations. The tours organised by the Department of Social Development are aimed at educating young people about the sacrifices the youth of 1976 had to make. The visits began from Wednesday night and end today. Minister Bathabile Dlamini led this year's tour under the theme, The year of Oliver Tambo: Unity in Action, Together Moving South Africa Forward .Other sites included Robben Island, but the trip was postponed due to bad weather.Dlamini said the aim was to tell untold stories that a democratic South Africa was not attained easily, but through bloodshed and sacrifice. It was the first time most of the youth would have visited Robben Island.Andrew Fumbatha from the Eastern Cape said he has learnt not to take democracy for granted because there are many unsung heroes .
