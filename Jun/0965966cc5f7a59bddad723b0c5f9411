Minister Senzeni Zokwana and Renee Thompson’s legal representatives conducted and finalised negotiations to bring proceedings to a halt in the Labour Court yesterday. Thompson waited anxiously outside court, and was provided feedback by her advocate, Peter Kantor, who returned to the courtroom to continue negotiating after receiving Thompson’s 
instructions. Kantor told the Cape Times that the matter had been concluded and a mutual agreement had been reached. The minister, who also serves as national SACP chairperson, had been issued court papers in April last year, when he was accused of discrimination and unfairly excluding Thompson from meetings. Thompson claimed that Zokwana appointed “black, Xhosa-speaking SACP members from the Eastern Cape to his office”. Insiders dismissed Thompson’s claims as “sour grapes”, and she was overlooked for the position of chief of staff. The litigation was considered “a symptom of the larger issues” within the department. The department had previously denied the allegations, calling them “extremely serious and deeply disparaging”. Department spokesperson Bomikazi Molapo declined to provide any details pertaining to the agreement.
