The assault recorded seemingly by a community member, shows the half-naked man tied to a pole by his genitalia while being hit with planks and kicked by onlookers. The man was accused 
of being caught in the act of raping a child, the incident occurring a day after the body of five-year-old Minentle Lekhatha was discovered about 1km from her home. Police spokesperson Andre Traut confirmed that the assault occurred and that police attended to the individual after family members 
had taken him to a day hospital. “Police had searched for any report against the man in the video with the express intention of arresting him should any exist. “There were no cases found and when asked if he would lay charges against his assailants he declined to do so,” said Traut. He said police were investigating the matter due to the seriousness of the allegations and the viciousness of the assault perpetrated against the man in the video. Police condemn all forms of vigilantism and would 
prosecute any person found guilty of taking the law into their own hands said Traut. Bishop Lavis CPF chairperson Graham Lindhorst said they are following up on the matter by meeting community members who may know more details regarding the allegations. “We are waiting to find any official record or why none has been made. I am following up with reports and visiting community members believed to know the identity of the victim or their family,” said Lindhorst. He said the CPF would also be meeting the Bishop Lavis Police Station’s commanding officer to enquire about the allegations made against the individual in the video. Anyone with information is requested to contact  Bishop Lavis Police on 0219359802 or Crime Stop  0860010111.
