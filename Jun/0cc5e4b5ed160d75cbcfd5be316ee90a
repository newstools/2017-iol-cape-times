This is part of the ongoing battle between the RTMC and Tasima over 
control of the eNatis system in the 
country. In the latest action, the RTMC is challenging the Labour Court ruling which instructed it to pay the salaries of 79 former Tasima employees who were operating the eNatis system. The Labour Court ruled on May 25 that the 79 employees were automatically transferred from Tasima to the RTMC since the agency took over the control of the system in April. Now, RTMC CEO Makhosini Msibi has told the Labour Appeal Court that a judge had make a mistake to make such a ruling. The agency was expected to argue that some of the employees that were supposed to be paid were hired after the Department of Transport had advised Tasima that its contract with the department had expired. The RTMC was also expected to argue that when a High Court in Pretoria 
initially ordered Tasima to return the 
eNatis system to the RTMC on June 23, 2015,   Tasima appealed against the decision 
and in the meantime allegedly proceeded to hire 10 more employees on a 
permanent basis. Sunday Independent
