The court has stressed that it could not make a determination on the minister's liability for the social grants saga. Dlamini and Sassa both had to make submissions to the ConCourt on Wednesday after failing to meet a 4pm deadline for submitting affidavits on Monday. Describing the minister as "coy", the court raised questions about her account of her involvement in the crisis at the social grants agency. According to the court, there "was no indication in the Minister's affidavit what, if anything, she did to keep up to date with progress between April and October 2016." She apparently assumed that she would be kept abreast of developments around the awarding of the social grants payment contract. IOL
