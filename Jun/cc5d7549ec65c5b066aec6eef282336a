It is back to the drawing board&nbsp;for the Home Affairs Department&nbsp; and workers after 90% of&nbsp; staff did not pitch up to work&nbsp; on a voluntary basis on Saturday.&nbsp; As a result, the majority of&nbsp; Home Affairs offices around&nbsp; the country were closed. This comes after a settlement&nbsp;agreement was reached&nbsp; on June 15, in terms of which&nbsp; staff would work on a voluntary&nbsp; basis on Saturdays and in turn receive one day off during&nbsp;the week. In a statement, Home&nbsp;Affairs said: The department&nbsp; wishes to apologise to the public&nbsp; and put it on record that&nbsp; it is disappointed by these developments as they are not&nbsp;in line with the spirit of the&nbsp; agreement. &nbsp; In 2015, Home Affairs introduced&nbsp; a new rotational work&nbsp; shift which required each&nbsp; employee to work between one&nbsp; and two Saturdays a month,&nbsp; depending on the size and need&nbsp; of a particular office. If an employee worked a&nbsp;Saturday shift during a particular&nbsp; week, he or she would&nbsp; be allowed to start work at 9am&nbsp; instead of 7.30am from Monday&nbsp; till Friday and work a half day&nbsp; on the Saturday.&nbsp; Department spokesperson&nbsp; David Hlabane said: Unions&nbsp; objected to this and asked that employees be paid overtime for&nbsp;working on Saturdays. They also said that working&nbsp;on Saturday would be&nbsp; taxing on employees in terms&nbsp; of transport as it would be&nbsp; an extra day of unbudgeted&nbsp; expenses. &nbsp; However, he said that the&nbsp; department did not have the&nbsp; money to pay employees for&nbsp; overtime. The department has no&nbsp;money for overtime and with&nbsp; cost-cutting measures in all&nbsp; national departments it would&nbsp; not be possible, he said. Hlabane said while the&nbsp;settlement agreement was&nbsp; good in theory, it was proving&nbsp; challenging in practice. We are very disappointed&nbsp;by what happened on Saturday&nbsp; because it affects the public. Saturdays are important to&nbsp;accommodate people who work&nbsp; during the week, he said.&nbsp; Hlabane said that this matter&nbsp; was urgent . He said management, along&nbsp;with the three unions involved,&nbsp; the Public Servants Association&nbsp; of South Africa (PSA),&nbsp; National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union&nbsp;(Nehawu), and the National&nbsp; Union of Public Service and&nbsp; Allied Workers (Nupsaw),&nbsp; would be going back to the bargaining council to find a&nbsp;solution. &nbsp;PSA s Ivan Fredericks said:&nbsp; We ll be monitoring the situation&nbsp; and go back to the drawing&nbsp; board to find a solution.
