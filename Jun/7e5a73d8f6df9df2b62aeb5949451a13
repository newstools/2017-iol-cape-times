This was the second beached whale this week, said City Law Enforcement head Wayne Dyason. “We were again called to the scene of a whale carcass that had beached on one of the city’s beaches. "This one was found between Big Bay and Melkbos Strand, and was also a very young mammal,” Dyason said. The carcass was removed yesterday afternoon and tests would be done to determine the cause of death. The whale found at Strandfontein Pavilion on Tuesday morning was a pygmy sperm whale. “The city’s Marine Unit came across a beached whale carcass at the Strandfontein Pavillion on the False Bay coastline. The carcass was about 1.8m to 2m in length,” he said. Dyason said the whale was found with a “gaping wound to its dorsal or back area”. “The cause of the wound is unconfirmed, and it is not clear if the wound contributed to the mammal’s death,” he said. All agencies responded to both scenes. Dyason said the Marine Unit would make a decision on how to best remove and dispose of the carcasses. “Tests will be done to determine the cause of death,” Dyason concluded. Dyason said they would investigate if the two incidents were linked.
