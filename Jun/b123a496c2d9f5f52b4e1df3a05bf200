The Democratic Nursing Organisation of SA (Denosa) intends to take legal action against the South African Nursing Council (SANC) over the cancellation of exams.The exams were cancelled over allegations that the May paper was leaked and the SANC came up with new dates for when they would be rewritten. The SANC has also said the students must not contact them directly regarding the matter, but rather to contact the principals of the Nursing Education Institutions (NEIs). SANC acting registrar and chief executive Sizeni Mchunu said that investigations were continuing and the necessary action would be instituted as soon as the investigations were completed. A security breach of this nature not only affects individual candidates, but demolishes the credibility of the entire examination and the integrity of nursing education in general. Denosa spokesperson Sbongiseni Dalihlazo said they had taken legal action against the SANC for the cancellation of the exams. We have received calls and e-mails from parents who are equally frustrated, as they have been with their children who mention how intense the preparations were and how committed their children were. The overwhelming feeling is that the SANC chose to take an easy way out of the situation by cancelling the exams for everybody and setting new dates while their own investigation was still under way, thereby punishing every student for something that the investigation may prove to have been done by a few students.
