His brother, Odwa, was also his donor in the transplant performed earlier this month. Bauti’s operation is one of 21 successful kidney transplants carried out at the hospital this year. Nine of the operations were from living donors. Bauti spent almost a year on dialysis after being diagnosed with serious kidney complications in 2016. He said it was hard in the period leading up to the operation as he had a job. The overjoyed Bauti said: “I feel like I'm a new person. I don't have any words to explain how grateful I am.” Four other members of his family were tested before Odwa was found to be a be a perfect match. Odwa had the ideal combination of blood type and tissue type for a transplant. Bauti is one of five pairs of kidney transplant recipients and donors, including four pairs of siblings and a pair of cousins, who shared their experiences at a media briefing, at Groote Schuur Hospital yesterday. Each of the five recipients of donor organs, at the briefing, underwent surgery. On average, 61 kidney transplants are now performed at Groote Schuur Hospital every year, compared to 50 yearly transplants performed before 2000. The demand for healthy organs is growing, and South African hospitals are struggling to meet the demand, according to Groote Schuur Hospital. There are too many people in need of kidney transplants who remain on dialysis “for years” awaiting a donor, said Bauti, who encourages South Africans to become organ donors, if they have not done so already. His sentiments are echoed in a statement by Groote Schuur, which implores South Africans to make the selfless decision to donate. “Giving the opportunity to live to someone else is the most unselfish act anyone can do”, a media release by the hospital stated.
