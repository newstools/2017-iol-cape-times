This comes after two incidents - a double murder in Welcome Estate and a carjacking and attempted murder in Kenwyn - were opened for investigation. Just before 10pm on Tuesday, two men were shot and killed in Welcome Estate, said police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana. “Two men, one of whom  was 48 - were shot dead. The other victim is still unidentified. Circumstances surrounding this incident are under investigation and suspects are yet to be arrested,” Rwexana said. On Monday at 9.30pm, police spokesperson FC van Wyk confirmed that a 33-year-old man in his car in Blanken Road, Kenwyn was accosted by two men. “They approached the driver and one pointed a firearm at him. ‘‘He was robbed of his wallet and cellphone and the suspects drove off in his vehicle,” he said. “The Neighbourhood Watch members reacted and followed the vehicle, which the suspects abandoned in Rifle Road, ” Van Wyk said. The suspects fled in different directions on foot, but through the efforts of the Neighbourhood Watch members and the police, they arrested one of them. “One of the suspects was apprehended on the corner of Joanne and Wetton roads. He fired a shot at the Neighbourhood Watch member but missed. “He was then arrested but he managed to throw away the firearm,” Van Wyk said. The suspect was found in possession of a magazine containing eight .9mm rounds. The stolen car’s ignition key was also found nearby. The suspect appeared in court yesterday. The other suspect is being sought by the police. Foflonker has urged the community to be more vigilant. He said a modus operandi had been noted. “Residents should get into the habit of rather reversing into their driveways as this makes it harder for criminals to sneak up on you. We have noticed in these cases criminals wear fezes and white thobes (long white robe). “In most cases, victims say they were busy talking on their phones when they were approached. “Sitting on the phone distracts people.”
