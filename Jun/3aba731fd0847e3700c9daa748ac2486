Protea Park community members were rocked by the murders of Octavia Skippers, 22, and Cleo, 2, whose bodies were dumped in a field almost 2km from their front door in Arcadia Crescent. Skippers said she could not believe the news when she found out who had been arrested for the brutal murders. “He came into my home regularly and was well known to our entire family. I cannot explain the emotions I am going through. "This man cannot be allowed to walk the streets if he is responsible for doing this horrible thing to us,” said Skippers. She said speculation within their community was upsetting and she hopes the police will find out the truth. While pleased police captured him so swiftly, the police and courts must do their part now and ensure the person responsible is sent to prison, said Skippers. The community of Protea Park came together yesterday to lay a wreath at the spot where the two bodies were found. Community activist and ward councillor Barbara Rass said the suspect had recently married. He was a father of two and had begun turning his life around after a troubled youth. “How could someone you know do this, creating fear and suspicion among a community that considered itself close-knit. "Police must leave no stone unturned in finding out the truth and prosecute this person to the full extent of the law,” said Rass. Police spokesperson Andre Traut confirmed that, after an extensive manhunt following the brutal murder, a suspect was arrested. “The manhunt came to an end when the 35-year-old suspect was arrested in Bellville on Thursday. Once charged, he is due to make a court appearance in Atlantis on two charges of murder,” said Traut. He said the finer details of the investigation could not be divulged and the suspect is scheduled to make his first appearance in Atlantis Magistrate’s Court today. Anyone with information about the crime is urged to contact Atlantis police on 021 571 8576 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za  Cape Times
