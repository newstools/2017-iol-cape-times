The Constitutional Court has left it up to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to decided whether to conduct a no confidence vote in President Jacob Zuma through a secret ballot.&nbsp; Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng read out the judgment on Thursday saying Mbete was wrong when she claimed she did not have the powers to allow for a secret ballot vote.&nbsp; He said the Constitutional Court did not have the power to order the Speaker to make such a decision.&nbsp; Mogoeng set out some avenues on what Mbete should consider when weighing whether or to allow such a vote.&nbsp; Mogoeng: To order the Speaker to allow for a&nbsp;#SecretBallot&nbsp;would trample the rule of separation of powers.&nbsp;@IOL</p> Zintle (@ZintleMahlati)&nbsp;June 22, 2017Picture: Zintle Mahlati/ANA Pictures Mbete had argued that she had no issue with a secret vote, but she had no powers to do so.&nbsp; The case was brought by the UDM, EFF, COPE and civil society organizations in May.&nbsp; The UDM argued that ANC MPs would be intimidated and faced party pressure if the vote was not done in secret.&nbsp; Mogoeng says it's up to National Assembly, through speaker, to allow for a open vote or a&nbsp;#SecretBallot&nbsp;in no confidence vote.&nbsp;@IOL</p>Tell a friendParliament Speaker Baleka Mbete File picture: Nic Bothma/EPA Zintle (@ZintleMahlati)&nbsp;June 22, 2017</blockquote></font> Mogoeng in his ruling said MPs were not bound to their parties and were instead there to serve the public as elected officials.&nbsp; Mbete would have to ensue that MPs are protected.&nbsp; Political parties react to ConCourt judgement on&nbsp;#SecretBallot.
