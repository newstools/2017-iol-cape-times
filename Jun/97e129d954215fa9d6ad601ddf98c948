The campaign will run from today until June 30 and is aimed at all children under 5 years old even if the child’s immunisations are up to date. This comes after a measles outbreak in Stellenbosch in February, where 29 cases were confirmed. During the 2008 outbreak well over 18 000 cases were reported. During this year’s outbreak about 15 500 pupils and children under 5 years old in affected areas in Stellenbosch and vulnerable areas in the Drakenstein were vaccinated against measles. Department spokesperson Jo-Anne Otto said the best manner in which to eradicate an infectious illness is to make sure that between 93% and 100% of people have immunity. “The various immunisation campaigns usually form part of a worldwide initiative to help eradicate an illness,” she said. “The secret to the success of any campaign is excellent team work between parents/caregivers and local clinics or health services. A campaign offers parents an opportunity to, with minimum effort, ensure that their child forms part of the worldwide eradication of measles. A consent form will be sent home with your child; parents need to sign and return the form to the school. Those parents who wish to can visit their local clinic or private child care provider,” she said. Some quick facts about measles: It takes only one infected child or person in a community to infect a whole bunch of other people - this is because everybody’s immune system fluctuates. Making sure that your child is protected means that even if he or she is in contact with an infected person, he will probably not contract the illness. In the event that someone who has been vaccinated contracts measles, it will be a much milder form, sometimes presenting with no more than a headache or mild fever.
