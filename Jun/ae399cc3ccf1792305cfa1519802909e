KDF chairperson Ndithini Tyhido said: “This time you visit Khayelitsha after a time it has been hit by a disaster. We know there is a plan for Knysna, but nobody can tell you what is the plan for Khayelitsha. "When people of Taiwan informal settlement are drowned in floods you don’t hear any bank announcing donations. The question is: what must happen before a black life matters?” Tyhido asked. He said the absence of a government disaster plan was a concern. “We can never be quiet, but we can never blame you, because it is a disaster, but why must we always complain?” asked Tyhido. Radebe, who also chairs the National Planning Commission, visited the Thusong Service Centre to engage on challenges facing the youth. Tyhido also told  Radebe that about half of Khayelitsha's residents were still using the bucket system to relieve themselves. Radebe talked to the gathering about unemployment, saying the private sector and entrepreneurs should work together to create jobs for the youth. He encouraged young people to create their own businesses. “You should realise that the future of this country is in your hands. If the economy is not growing we will not be able to solve unemployment,” said Radebe. National Youth Development Agency board chairperson Sifiso Mtsweni said the agency had gone around the country to inform the youth of the various programmes they offered.
