Parliament s portfolio committee on communications on Thursday urged people to nominate suitably qualified candidates to serve on the board of the troubled SABC before the deadline on Friday. Members of the board must, when viewed collectively, represent a broad cross-section of the population of the Republic and be persons who are committed to the objects and principles as enunciated in the charter of the corporation, committee chairman Humphrey Maxegwana said. The nominee s CV should contain full names, ID number, gender, contact details, previous work experience, as well as certified copies of academic qualifications and ID document. The committee will shortlist candidates before interviews commence. A list of recommended candidates will then be submitted to the National Assembly for adoption.Nominations and CVs can be sent to the committee secretary, Thembinkosi Ngoma, at 3rd Floor, 90 Plein Street, Cape Town, 8001 or via email to [email&#160;protected] or fax number 086 522 5740.&nbsp;Telephonic enquiries can be made to 021 403 3733 or 083 709 8407. &nbsp;The SABC currently has an interim board in place following the collapse of the previous permanent board. In terms of the Broadcasting Act, the interim board is only allowed to exist for six months. African News Agency
