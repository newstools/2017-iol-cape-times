We need the names of schools and geographical location of the schools sampled. As soon as we have that and have worked through it, we will decide on a meeting date, Kivedo said.But EE provincial deputy head Noncedo Madubedube said EE gave the portfolio committee its full social audit report, an executive summary, and a picture essay. These three documents show our findings gathered from 224 schools around the Western Cape, and comprehensive detail on the methodology used.
