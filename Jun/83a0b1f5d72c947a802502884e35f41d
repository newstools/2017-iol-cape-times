Brian Molefe was yesterday accused of trying to delay proceedings in the Labour Court.&nbsp; Molefe, who was in the high court in Pretoria for his urgent appeal to challenge his dismissal as Eskom chief executive, asked that his case be referred for arbitration or for trial.&nbsp; His legal counsel, advocate Noel Graves, said Judge Christina Prinsloo should stay the case because the&nbsp;court still has to decide on the version of events regarding Molefe s departure.&nbsp; But the DA and EFF, which are challenging his return to Eskom, would have none of it. Counsel for the EFF, advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, questioned Molefe s motive, saying: There's no basis for the case to be referred for a trial. What Mr Molefe wants is a postponement.&nbsp; &quot;He applied for an urgent application and now because his matter is not urgent, he wants a postponement. DA legal representative Paul Kennedy asked that Molefe s case be struck off the roll and if Molefe wants the matter to go for arbitration, he should withdraw his application. Judge Prinsloo reserved judgment.
