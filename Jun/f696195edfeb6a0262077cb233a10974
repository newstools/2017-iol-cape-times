“The CPF was never informed of the missing girl. We could not institute a search to assist, and this happens quite often. Police have handled this very badly because, had we been informed, we would have related that information to the community immediately,”  said spokesperson Philip Bam. This as the search for 15-year-old Erin entered its 16th day yesterday. She was last seen on June 2 at Grassy Park bus station, wearing a grey hoodie jacket, light blue jeans and black takkies. The Cape Times understands the child was reported missing on June 15. Bam said the CPF received a lead yesterday which they would follow up. “We regret that we could not do anything about this because we did not know about it,” he said. Yesterday police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana appealed for public assistance to locate Erin. “According to information the child contacts her parents but doesn’t return home. The search for her continues.”
