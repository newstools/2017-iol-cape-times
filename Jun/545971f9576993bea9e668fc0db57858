Johannesburg - A group of bogus doctors who were found guilty of illegally terminating pregnancies were sentenced to six months imprisonment by the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court, police said on Wednesday. Police spokesperson, Captain Xoli Mbele, said Francis Holalet Mbouaffou, 48, Liancio Neddy Ekombe, 36, William Mosito Mogaila, 52, Ghislaine Lobe Moseka Elema, 47, and Paul Gbagnonhoue, 59, were found guilty for Contravention of Section 7 and 10 of Act 92 of 1996: Choice of Termination of Pregnancy. Thegroup were sentenced to six months imprisonment suspended for five years, with Mogaila and Gbagnonhoue given the option of a R20,000 fine. Mbele said that in September 2014 police had held an operation at the Lister Building on the corner of Small and Jeppe streets in Johannesburg concerning a bogus clinic terminating pregnancy. “All the suspects arrested failed to produce certificate to practice as doctors. Foetus of baby was also recovered inside the fridge,” she said. “They terminated a pregnancy of a 16-year-old female. Several females were found in different rooms of the building to terminate pregnancy.” – African News Agency (ANA)
