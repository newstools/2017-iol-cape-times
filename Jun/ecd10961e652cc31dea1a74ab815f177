The NSRI suspects that the nurse shark may have been deliberately dumped in the pool by a fisher for unknown reasons. The shark has since been rescued from the Manaba Tidal Pool, Margate after the NSRI and members of the Natal Sharks Board, along with police and the Tower 13 lifeguard organisation were called to investigate. NSRI Shelley Beach station commander Jeremiah Jackson said rescuers initially thought that the trapped shark would be able to leave  the pool during high tide, but it soon became apparent that the shark would not be able to get out of the well-protected pool without assistance. Jackson said the shark was removed from the pool thanks to a local unidentified fisher. The shark was unharmed following the rescue.
