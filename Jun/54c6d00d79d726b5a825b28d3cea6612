Water from streams, springs and boreholes should be disinfected or boiled. The city said water from alternative sources is not safe and that 
the sources have not been tested by the 
municipality. Xanthea Limberg, mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water, 
waste services and energy, said: “Should residents continue to collect water from alternative sources, it is essential from a health point of view to boil it beforehand. “Members of the public use these water sources at their own risk. “Ground water, spring and urban stream sources do not form part of the city’s formal water supply system. “The only source of safe water is that from the municipality.” Cape Argus
