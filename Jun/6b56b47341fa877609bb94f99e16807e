Shebeen owners picketed outside Parliament yesterday to express their concerns about a new law seeking to clamp down on illegal liquor outlets and report non-compliance to the police. Lifa Mapilo of the Western Cape Liquor Traders Organisation said: “They want to impose laws without consulting us. This while 2000 liquor licence applications were rejected  in 2015. “They want to impose fines on us small black-owned businesses, while big business floods the townships.” Mapilo said their organisation was supporting Cape Flats shebeens yesterday.  They wanted the government to engage with them. “We understand the abuse of alcohol is a problem but taverns and shebeens cannot be to blame while big businesses also sell alcohol. It will always be around. Close one shebeen and another will open. “Give people a licence and give shebeens a permit so they can be regulated and pay tax which can be used to invest in health, schools and rehabs.” Dan Plato, the Western Cape Minister of Community Safety, said: “The Western Cape has a serious problem with alcohol. The abuse of substances in this province, and alcohol in particular, is considered to be one of the key causes of car crashes and interpersonal violence. "The draft regulations to the Western Cape Liquor Regulations were published and seven public consultation sessions were hosted between  January 27 and February 7. 
"The deadline for public comment was February 28. More than 160 comments were received on the regulations and all were considered accordingly. “There is no specific target against shebeens. The regulations address all non-compliance by licensed outlets. The WCLA reports unlicensed outlets to the SAPS who are mandated with addressing illegal outlets.” Plato urged the organisation to work with the provincial government.
