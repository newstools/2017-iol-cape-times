Tireless in his efforts to serve with “fairness”, Bernickow, who was a Media Workers’ Association of South Africa (Mwasa) organiser and a determined activist during the dark days of apartheid when the press was severely crippled by state of emergency laws, was recently appointed as the public representative on the Western Cape Chapter of Independent Media’s Ombud Appeals Panel. Yesterday, Independent Media executive chairman Dr Iqbal Survé said he was “deeply saddened” by Bernickow’s death and that “many Struggle journalists will remember him as a tough trade unionist, who stood by what he believed in”. “Ronald represented a rare breed of activist, who came through the Struggle of the eighties and who continued to serve our people with pride and dignity. There was not much Ronald would not, or could not do. He will be remembered for his sense of fairness and for his humility,” said Dr Survé. Independent Media Ombudsman Jovial Rantao said the office of the ombudsman was deeply saddened by the loss of Bernickow, who was “an astute man, a consummate professional, a loving father and a lifelong activist for truth and fairness”. Fellow panellist Rich Mkhondo described Bernickow as a “man with a big heart, a gentle giant who has left so many memories. Gone from our sights, but forever in our hearts”. Cape Argus editor Aziz Hartley said his own commitment to the cause of media workers was “thanks to people like Bernie” who was “a very determined and tenacious union organiser”.
