Oliphant, 26, accepted the offer to do a Masters of Fine Arts in Directing for Theatre Degree, from September 2017 until 2020, after successfully auditioning at the university in February. He submitted an autobiographical essay about his theatrical inspiration and intent and a 20-minute video of his directorial experience and style in theatre, said Oliphant. He has so far raised R50 000 of the R400 000 required for the course fees, accommodation and travel costs. “The cost of international study is extremely expensive. I have spent months applying to various institutions and companies to assist in funding and I am still waiting for the outcomes. I am now trying my hand at crowd-funding and reaching out for support from all of you. “Any contribution to this campaign and my journey will be greatly appreciated no matter how big, or small,” said Oliphant, who has to find the monies by the end of June. He has performed alongside South African music veterans such as Karen Zoid, Melanie Scholtz and Aviva Pelham. He also had principle roles in productions such as: The Sound of Music (Artscape 2002), Nunsense A-men (Artscape 2009), Fiddler on the Roof, Guys and Dolls (Artscape 2013) where he was assistant director.
