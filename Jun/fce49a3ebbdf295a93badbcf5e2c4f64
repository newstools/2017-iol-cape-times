Ronelle Prins, an employee at Pinnacle, says she has been suspended from work for wearing her natural curls. Prins was suspended after she recently shared her story with an online blog. She said a supervisor suggested she have a Brazilian blow-out as opposed to embracing her natural hair. Even though Prins has worked at the company for about three years, she said her hair has recently become a problem. She says other issues such as her "cleanliness" has also come into play. "They have told me that my (company-issued) jacket is always dirty but I work in a warehouse where we dispatch items from and my jacket is sometimes covered in dust. Although this was part of details surrounding my suspension, a big part of it is due to my hair according to the company," Prins said. The company responded to the blog by saying the matter had to be dealt with internally, and a grievance was supposed to be lodged. Prins says she did not want to go this route as she felt "it would be swept under the mat". The is a developing story.
