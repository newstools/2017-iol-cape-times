I write to ask that you please publish this public acknowledgement of the extraordinary kindness and care of the manager of the Brenton Breakers Hotel, Mrs Marike Nienaber, and her husband, who saved the life of my father John Araujo and that of Marianne Skaife on Wednesday. Mrs Nienaber ensured my father, 71, and Marianne, who is of similar age and currently undergoing chemotherapy and is resultantly not physically strong, were rescued from Brenton-on-Sea when, having left their homes due to the catastrophic fire, were then hemmed in at the beachfront of Brenton-on-Sea between the oncoming fire and the sea. Mrs Nienaber alerted emergency services and informed the ad-hoc rescue parties. This resulted that Mr Nienaber, with the exceptional help of the George 4x4 Club, drove over the beach from Buffelsbaai and saved my father and Marianne. My personal profound and deep thanks and that of my sisters, and of all the Araujo family to the Nienabers, and our thanks also to the Bos family of Sedgefield, who have given shelter to my father at this time.
