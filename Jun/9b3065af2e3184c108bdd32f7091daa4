Washington - The hosts of the "Morning Joe" television show are
questioning US President Donald Trump's "unmoored behavior" after he
lashed out at them in a Twitter rant this week. "America's leaders and allies are asking themselves yet again whether
this man is fit to be president," Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski
wrote in an opinion article published Friday by the Washington Post. Trump had tweeted Thursday calling them "low IQ Crazy Mika" and
"Psycho Joe." He claimed that they tried to visit him at his
Mar-a-Lago resort and club in Florida, and that Brzezinski at the
time was "bleeding badly from a face-lift." Brzezinski, a Democrat and daughter of the late Zbigniew Brzezinski,
who was national security adviser to president Jimmy Carter
(1977-81), and Scarborough, a Republican former congressman from
Florida, confirmed early this year that they were a couple.          "I'm fine. My family brought me up really tough," she said Friday on
their show, which is broadcast by cable news channel MSNBC. "This is absolutely nothing for me personally. But I'm very concerned
about what this once again reveals about the president of the United
States." Scarborough said on air: "We're OK. The country is not." dpa
