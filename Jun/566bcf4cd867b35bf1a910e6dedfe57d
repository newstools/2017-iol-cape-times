Doctors at Tygerberg Hospital fear the Uitsig resident hailed a hero after narrowly escaping death when saving his family s belongings during a fire, may lose his sight. Peter Kortje, 25, tried in vain to salvage a television set as the fire raged on Friday before the TV exploded in his face, leaving him partially blind. The fire gutted 17 backyard structures in Jacaranda Street. His mother and the eldest of the displaced, Johanna Kortje, 64, said Peter had tried to prevent the fire spreading to their homes. If someone had not taken him out in time, he could have burnt to death. He was supposed to undergo surgery, and the doctor explained to me there is a possibility that he might lose the sight in his left eye. We are praying for a miracle, Johanna said. Since the weekend, 55 people have been housed at the Uitsig Community Centre while they wait for their emergency structures to be rebuilt. The community here has been very supportive and they have asked why they do not move me to an old age home, but I do not want to go there. I feel way better here with my family and neighbours, Johanna said. The city has sent 17 structures to the affected residents, but they cannot be erected yet due to the soil not being conducive for construction. Ward councillor Beverley van Reenen said the city came out to the site of the fire and assisted by removing debris with digger loaders and a grabber machine. The ground must now be made level and compacted so that they are able to rebuild the structures, but currently the ground is too loose to build on. We are hoping the city can get it done by today, Van Reenen said. Another resident, Patricia Lucas, said: There has been clothing donations, but they need jerseys to keep warm.
