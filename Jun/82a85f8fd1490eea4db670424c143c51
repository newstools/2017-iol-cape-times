Former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s disciplinary hearing is set to resume on Friday in Johannesburg. He faces charges relating to an unauthorised media briefing he held two months ago, at which he criticised the SABC interim board and praised himself on the good work he said he did while at the public broadcaster. Motsoeneng’s fight with the SABC was dealt a blow last week when his attempt to stop the disciplinary proceedings was thrown out by the Labour Court. Various courts had found Motsoeneng’s appointment as COO to be unlawful. A ruling by the Western Cape High Court in December last year found that he was unfit to hold any office until such time a fresh disciplinary hearing cleared him of any wrongdoing, or if a court set aside the Public Protector’s report which implicated him in lying about his academic qualifications, purging staff, and giving himself generous salary increases. The SABC rescinded its decision to take the Public Protector’s report on review, paving the way for a disciplinary process against Motsoeneng. Well-known advocate Zola Majavu is Motsoeneng’s legal representative. The hearing would start at 2pm and is chaired by advocate Nazeer Cassim. – African News Agency (ANA)
