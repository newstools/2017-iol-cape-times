As part of restoring hope to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, Crystal August will deliver 20 care packages on her birthday tomorrow.August s Restoring Hope with Chemo Care bags campaign began when she participated in the Greyton classic 17km trail to raise funds earlier this month. Her Birthday of Hope (BOH) initiative began five years ago and each year she undertakes a different cause close to her personal life. Over the past three years I have lost three family members because of cancer, making this cause very personal for me. &quot;With funds raised through participating in the Greyton classic on June 17, we were able to provide items for 20 care bags for patients at Tygerberg Care Home, said August.With creams, blankets, toiletries and some luxuries, the care packages are to help patients undergoing chemo and spending six to 12 weeks away from family, said August. Each year for me is a blessing and with that a responsibility to give back. With my initiative (BOH) I have found my purpose in life, said August.She also hopes it will encourage future generations, especially young women, to pursue their dreams.An avid runner, August participates in road competitions and uses them to raise funds for her initiative. During Women s Month in August, she will undertake another 5km road event.To donate to the Chemo Care bags campaign, call 0721350274 or send an e-mail to [email&#160;protected] [email&#160;protected]
