The bodies of De Bruin, the youngest of Skippers’ three children, and Cleo were found partially buried on Tuesday in a field close to their home in Arcadia Crescent, Protea Park. Yesterday, Skippers struggled to hold back tears as she said she felt that their murderer had “ripped her child from her grasp”. She said she was unable to view the bodies at the morgue yesterday. Her husband and daughter would go on her behalf today. She was unable to continue talking and  activist and ward councillor Barbara Rass spoke on behalf of the family. She said the community was standing by them during this testing time. “The family told us that Octavia left on Saturday to visit a friend in Witsand, where she often spent a few days and then returned home. “She would always cut through the field, which the community uses as a short cut. “They became concerned when she did not return on Monday,” said Rass. She said they would assist the family in laying their loved ones to rest but the family required more assistance. The situation was reminiscent of two 2012 murders for Rass. She remembers when two other mothers were murdered and their bodies left in a field. In April that year, the decomposing bodies of Marshay Louw and her 18-month-old baby Tatum were found dumped in a field next to Sherwood Park. Mother of three and seven-month pregnant Liezel Wagner’s badly bruised and half-naked body was found in the same field in August of that year. Rass said De Bruin and her daughter’s killer must be brought to justice. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said a man has been arrested and the investigation continues. Those wishing to assist the family can contact Rass on 0820995833. Anyone with information is urged to contact Atlantis police on 0215718576 or Crime Stop on 0860010111.
