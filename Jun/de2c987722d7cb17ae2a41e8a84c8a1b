Twenty-two-year-old Joshua Emanuel from Milnerton and 18-year-old Ross Player from Claremont braved big waves and gale-force winds, about three hours outside the city, at a secluded beach at Buffelsjagbaai, between Gansbaai and Struisbaai. The two did not break the current record of 28.6m, although Emanuel reached a height of about 26m and they were still proud of their achievement. Emanuel, who has been kite surfing for 13 years, said: “I am stoked to know we rode the biggest storm ever. “It was a successful trip, well worth it.” He describes wind conditions as strong as 120km/h at the time and the experience as “exhilarating”. He is currently sitting second on the WOO Kite Leaderboard for the highest kite-surfing jump at 27.6m. His teammate, Player, sits at number 12, with 24.4m, but only managed to reach about 23m on Wednesday. Despite this, Player said: “Not many people get the opportunity to surf in such good wind conditions. “We want to push our limits, set records and be the best at what we do.” The attempt was also in preparation for the Redbull Megaloop Challenge. The challenge event will take place in Holland. The two were invited to contend for honours as they are among the world’s top competitors in the high-flying sport. Their friend and fellow surfer Adi Kaimowitz said: “These are guys I look up to, their skill level is so high. “They basically risked their lives. I think it was a great achievement.”  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
