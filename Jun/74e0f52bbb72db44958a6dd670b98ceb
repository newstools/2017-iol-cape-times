Two of the injured were in a critical condition in hospital. Regional Correctional Services commissioner Delekile Klaas, who was at the scene last night, said the fight broke out between the 26 and 28s prison gangs. He said officials recovered makeshift weapons. Klaas said no prison wardens had been injured during the incident. “The alarm went off and we called for backup - even those who had knocked off were asked to come back to help maintain order. We searched the area and recovered the weapons that were used,” he said.
