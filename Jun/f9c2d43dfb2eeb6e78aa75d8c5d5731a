Mayoral committee member for corporate services Xanthea Limberg will open the “Think Water” exhibition which will showcase Swedish clean-tech company Orbital System’s Water Saving and Alternative Water Equipment Exhibition stall. Orbital manager Maria Silfverschiöld said: “I saw that Patricia de Lille was very involved in the drought crisis and devoted to solving it by all means, so I brought the device to her attention. I’m launching it in South Africa for the first time in the Cape.” Explaining that the water-recycling device uses electrical power, and is connected to a shower wall’s piping, or installed underground below the shower base, she added: “So, it’s a water recycling technology, meaning while one showers the water circulates through the device’s sensory and ultra-violet filter that purifies the recycled water (and returns it to the shower nozzle for re-use. After purification the water comes out even cleaner. “The benefits of this is that there is a 90% water saving and 80% (electric) energy saving, because we circulate the heated up water, which does not have to be reheated as much. We are commercialising a Nasa technology used by Mars Mission astronauts that recycles water to create a new paradigm in daily water usage.” De Lille’s spokesperson, Zara Nicholson, said the mayor is due to attend the exhibition on Sunday.
