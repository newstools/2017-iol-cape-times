In the video, the 41-year-old man is tied to a post by his genitals, beaten with sticks and kicked continuously to the chants of onlookers, with community members claiming he had been caught assaulting the girl. At the time police found no charges against him but continued to investigate the matter. Yesterday, police spokesperson Andre Traut confirmed a complaint of sexual assault had been lodged against the man. “A case of sexual assault of a 9-year-old girl has been reported and the suspect, a 41-year-old male, has been arrested. He is currently detained in hospital under police guard, due to the injuries sustained when he was assaulted by community members,” said Traut. He said the suspect had also decided to lay assault charges against the community members, and police will continue to investigate the matter. Community Policing Forum chairperson Graham Lindhorst said the community welcomed the arrest. “The girl went to the police station last week and was taken to a doctor who tested her but found no sign of rape. Her parents decided not to make a case but the community found out and took the law into their own hands,” said Lindhorst. Traut said police were cracking down on crimes against women and children and their pursuit for answers resulted in the arrest. Due to the recent spike in violent crimes against women and children, the Western Cape police were prioritising such cases, he said. Traut reiterated police condemned vigilantism in any form and that those involved would be prosecuted.
