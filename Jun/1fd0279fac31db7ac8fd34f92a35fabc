The Khayelitsha Development Forum (KDF) has hailed the Lingelethu West Police station officers for their heroic efforts when fighting back what they have described as a military style attack on Tuesday night. The forum says a police officer was wounded when the armed suspects opened fire at the officers in Khayelitsha.KDF chairperson Ndithini Tyhido said two assailants were armed with two R5 assault rifles and one armed with a handgun. The KDF salutes the SAPS Lingelethu for the heroic fight back that has prevented the assailants from gaining access to more weapons to terrorise our community, he said.Tyhido encouraged the Khayelitsha Safety and Security Forum (KSSF) to focus more on keeping Khayelitsha safe rather than exhausting its meagre resources on activities that divides the community. The KSSF should demand from Mayco member responsible for sector two under ODTP councillor Anda Ntsodo that the installation and servicing of the CCTV cameras be prioritized&nbsp;by the City of Cape Town. The KDF further demand that the City of Cape Town immediately install CCTV cameras in three police precincts in Khayelitsha as this could have helped the police to identify suspects who engage in these types of violent crimes, he said.Cape Times
