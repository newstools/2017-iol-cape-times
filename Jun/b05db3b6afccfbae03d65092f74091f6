The ruling ANC on Friday called on the government to urgently seek the authenticity of thousands of e-mails which purport to prove the nefarious ties between the government and the Gupta family, who are close allies of President Jacob Zuma. Responding to the series of e-mails, which purportedly include those between the family, their allies and government ministers, the ANC said it viewed the allegations as worrying as they questioned the integrity of government. “The ANC views these allegations in a very serious light, as if left unattended, they call into question the integrity and credibility of the government and the use of state resources under the direction of or to the benefit of private interests,” a statement from the ANC said. “Such matters cannot be allowed to fester in the public domain. Accordingly, the African National Congress calls on government to urgently seek to establish the veracity of these claims and explanation from those implicated.” The party called on the government to immediately implement the ANC national executive committee resolution to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry to probe state capture.
