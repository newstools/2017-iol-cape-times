The inside centre got his chance when the likes of Rohan Janse van Rensburg and Damian de Allende were ruled out with injury and, boy, did he grab it. The Bulls man was a tower of strength in defence and he looked threatening every time he touched the ball. Pure class. Sizing up the coaches Allister Coetzee’s selections were mainly spot-on, while the game plan, too, suited those players. The addition of Franco Smith and Brendan Venter is clear to see and has boosted the team significantly - the defence is especially much improved. With Matt Proudfoot and Johan van Graan, they look a happy camp. Star of the backline – Elton Jantjies He went into the series with   – a question mark hanging over his head: Was he the real deal at Test level or simply a Super Rugby player? He showed he can wear the No10 for many years to come. He kicked superbly and his game management was top notch. Star of the forwards – Franco Mostert Well done to coach Coetzee for backing Lions lock Mostert. The fairly string-bean second row forward stood back for no one, tackled like a man possessed and ran the line-outs like a seasoned pro. He, too, has a bright Bok future. Moment of the series Ross Cronje’s try at Loftus when Warren Whiteley called the throw on him at the back of the line-out was wonderfully executed. It showed how aware the Boks were of the space available after the French fullback had been sin-binned. A close second was the line-out move involving Serfontein at Ellis Park on Saturday, which led to Eben Etzebeth’s try. Moment to forget Warren Whiteley being ruled out of his home Test. He didn’t deserve that; not after playing such a big role in helping the team turn things around this season.
