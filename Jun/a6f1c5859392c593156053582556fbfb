Howard Oliver, the convicted murderer and rapist of 16-year-old Franziska Blöchliger, will spend the rest of his life in jail following the judgment handed down on Wednesday by Judge Kate Savage. This brings to a close the trial of the young girl from Kalk Bay who was murdered after she went jogging in the Tokai Forest last year. The 28-year-old Oliver, a father of two from Westlake Village, confessed to the double rape (anally and vaginally), murder and robbery of the teen, and had pleaded for mercy from the court in a letter read by his advocate last week. Oliver leered over the dock as Judge Savage read out her ruling. The minimum sentence applied for the rapes and murder would be life imprisonment. In her judgment, Judge Savage explained that during the course of the trial and despite acknowledging guilt, Howard had never admitted to the severity of the crime or gave an explanation about why he committed the crimes. Oliver received two life sentences for the rapes and the murder, and also received 15 years for robbery with aggravating circumstances. Judge Savage said that no court can return a child to a parent, but in passing this sentence it is hoped that Franziska’s family receive some measure of justice.
