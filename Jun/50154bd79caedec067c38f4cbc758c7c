Moves on Sunday morning to disband the ANC’s largest region in the Western Cape resulted in all but one of the six regional bosses to voice their dismay, and instead they have called for the party’s provincial executive committee to be disbanded. Regional secretaries and chairperson’s from Cape Town Metro (Dullah Omar), Boland, Overberg, West Coast, and Central Karoo held a press conference at a hotel near Parliament to describe the “witchcraft” at the party’s provincial executive committee meeting, and decision taken to disband Dullah Omar.

ANC Dullah Omar regional secretary Xolani Sotashe on why some in the party demand that its provincial executive committee be disbanded.  Along with the disbandment, those at a press conference also claimed that the powers of the ANC’s Boland region would have been curtailed. ANC Dullah Omar chairperson Xolani Sotashe said his region constituted 60% of province’s population. Sotashe said the provincial executive have been at the helm of a “series of anti-ANC activities”. “We’ve been raising this. We can’t fold arms when the movement is going down,” said Sotashe. He was also critical of the ANC “caretakers”, Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba and Sue van der Merwe who were appointed last year amidst the controversies which had embroiled former chairperson Marius Fransman and under-fire provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs.
