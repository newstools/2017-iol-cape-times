The commission's investigation found that Cakaca AC 1892 (Pty) Ltd (Cakaca), Southern Ambition 1668 trading Southern Ambition and Zamantlane Construction and Cleaning trading as Zamantlane colluded by discussing and co-ordinating the preparation of their respective bids in respect of a City tender. According to the commission, the managing director of Southern Ambition assisted in completing and signing the bid documents for all the respondents, including the pricing schedule. The commission also found that Cakaca and Southern Ambition have common shareholders and directors. The three companies compete in the supply and delivery of padlocks to high, medium, low voltage facilities and access. The City had approached the commission after it suspected that the companies may have exchanged documents in the process of preparing their respective tender documents. This, after it issued invitations to tender to various companies (including the respondents) for the supply and delivery of padlocks for equipment and access in August 2014. The commission received a complaint from the City of Cape Town in April 2016 against the companies. The commission said: “In referring the matter to the Tribunal for adjudication, the commission seeks an order declaring that the respondents contravened the Competition Act and that they are liable for payment of a fine equal to 10% of their respective annual turnover.” Yesterday, finance Mayco member Johan van der Merwe said: “The City of Cape Town welcomes the work that has been done by the Competition Commission and awaits the outcome of this matter.”
