President Jacob Zuma s opponents will push to have the decision for a judicial commission into state capture rubber-stamped at the ANC s 5th national policy conference. It is expected the debate into the matter - which will include the recent leaked Gupta emails - will push Zuma and some of his ministers into a corner.The president and several ministers have been accused of sharing state information with the Gupta family, among others.The debate will also be a proxy for the battle for the ANC in the run up to its elective conference in December.Independent Media understands that Zuma s detractors believe that the inquiry will further weaken the campaign of former AU Commission head Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma.This comes as ANC heavyweight and former Gauteng premier Tokyo Sexwale yesterday put the blame for the rampant alleged corruption in state owned entities on Zuma, saying he was a suspect .Sexwale s latest indictment of Zuma followed an investigative report commissioned by the former human settlements minister which described how public funds were used to assist the Guptas to purchase mining firm Tegeta.Sexwale appointed advocate Geoff Budlender SC in November to probe allegations of corruption at Trillian Capital Partners - where he was the independent executive chairperson - after various reports in the media implicated Trillian in corrupt acts amounting to billions of rands.In one of the allegations, Budlender was tasked with establishing if Trillian chief executive Eric Wood was aware of Zuma s intention to fire Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister prior to doing in December 2015.In his report, Budlender uncovered an illegal payment of more than a quarter of a billion rand that was transferred from Eskom into the accounts of Trillian subsidiary companies allegedly without tendering for any of the jobs for which the payments were made.Budlender also made a similar finding against Transnet, especially its engineering division.According to Budlender s observations, these funds were allegedly used to support various illegal business initiatives of the Gupta family.Detailing the modus operandi, Budlender said Tegeta Exploration and Resources purchased controlling shares in Optimum Coal Holdings under circumstances of considerable controversy after Eskom allegedly improperly facilitated the deal for the benefit of Tegeta shareholders.The Tegeta shareholders are: Guptas 29%; 28.53% is owned by Mabengela Investment, of which Zuma s son Duduzane holds 45%, and Rajesh Cumar Gupta holds 25%; 2% is owned by Ashu Chawla, chief executive of the Gupta-owned Sahara Company and 21.5% is owned by Elgasolve. He corroborated then public protector Thuli Madonsela s findings in the State of Capture report that between December 11, 2015 and April 14, 2016 more than R2.4bn was paid into the Bank of Baroda s account for the benefit of Tegeta.Zuma s spokesperson, Dr Bongani Ngqulunga, was not available for comment at the time of going to press.However, Trillian said it was not given an opportunity to comment on the contents of the report. Nonetheless, Trillian will consider all of the allegations contained therein, many of which appear to be incorrect even if one has reference to recent press articles relating to... Nene.
