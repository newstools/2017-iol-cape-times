Cape Town - Supporters of Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma are hopeful that the ANC s national executive committee will intervene, and reverse a decision taken by the party s provincial executive committee to dissolve the leadership of the Dullah Omar ( Cape Town metro) region. On Tuesday morning it was the chance of the ANC Youth League s regional task team to make their case against the party s PEC, particularly its provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs. On Monday the ANC provincial executive formally announced a decision, taken at a contested meeting in the early hours of Sunday to disband the leadership of the Dullah Omar region. But the ANCYL has described the disbandment as thuggish , It s spokesperson in the region Luzuko Bashman said:&quot; As the Youth League of the ANC in Dullah Omar Region, we cannot be silent whilst the ANC in the province is under attack and being destroyed by a destructive, factional and incompetent PEC . The youth league s task team had a meeting on Monday in which they resolved to challenge and fight the ANC s provincial executive s decision to disband the largest region in the Western Cape. Jacobs had painted a picture of the ANC s regional structure which was dysfunctional, drive by factional battles with gatekeeping ensuring that power was concentrated among a small clique.Bashman said: The reality we faced with is an incompetent PEC which has surrendered itself&nbsp; to a cancerous faction which to date has dismally failed to influence branches of the ANC in Dullah Omar Region and other regions across province in line with their factional and corrupt agenda of buying membership and stealing branches ahead of the national policy and elective conference this year .
