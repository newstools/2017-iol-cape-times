Johannesburg - The ANC says the DA is making a “mockery of the democracy it claims to uphold”, after reports emerged that the party will subject its councillors in Mogale City Local Municipality to lie-detector tests following the removal of DA Mayor Michael Holenstein.  Holenstein was removed last week following a motion of no confidence, where 39 councillors voted in favour, while 38 voted against the motion.  The DA led a coalition government in the municipality which means one councillor from the coalition voted with the ANC leading to Holenstein’s ousting.  News24 reports that DA councillors were taking the tests willingly and financing it themselves, according to DA Gauteng leader John Moodey.  The ANC said on Wednesday that by not accepting the results, the DA was showing South Africans that it could not be trusted.   “DA will say and claim to fight for anything for purposes of political expedience, while in reality and within their own party they stand opposed and will enforce draconian measures against the very “freedoms” they claim they want for others,” said the ANC in a statement.
