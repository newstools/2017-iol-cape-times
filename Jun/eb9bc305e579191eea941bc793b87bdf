Mayoral committee member for Area North Suzette Little said public access to Big Bay Beach would be closed until the dunes were stable. The official was taken to hospital. Little said: “Big Bay Beach has suffered extensive damage and erosion as a result of the stormy weather over the past 48 hours. The area is unstable and unsafe.” The city has urged the public to adhere to the interim restrictions for their own safety. Disaster Risk Management spokesperson Charlotte Powell said mop-up operations had been conducted across the city yesterday. She said roofs had blown off buildings in various communities. Only one fatality was reported in the metropole as a result of the storm. Uprooted trees were being removed to clear roadways. Informal areas affected by flooding are Imizamo Yethu in Hout Bay, where 827 structures and 2502 people were affected. Four hundred people were displaced in Macassar Village. Humanitarian relief has been provided for these communities. Train services were still recovering from the effects of the storm, with only some services fully operational and maintenance continuing at others. #OperationSA and the Al-Imdaad Foundation have launched an urgent appeal for funds to assist victims of the storm and fires, with a target of R1 million within 24 hours.
