President Jacob Zuma has rejected a secret ballot, telling Parliament on Thursday MPs should vote using an open ballot as they have done in the previous seven motions of no confidence against him. This has put pressure on Speaker Baleka Mbete, who earlier said she was willing to consider a secret ballot after the Constitutional Court judgment. Zuma, who was answering questions in the National Assembly, also dismissed calls by opposition MPs for him to go. He said he was a fit and proper person to lead the country despite the growing calls from opposition parties, within the ANC and civil society, to step down. Zuma also denied that he has secured business deals for his son, Duduzane, in government following reports. Zuma accused DA leader Mmusi Maimane of trying to steal ANC votes in Parliament by demanding a secret ballot in the motion of no confidence. He said the DA and other opposition parties do not have a majority in the House and they should accept that. How did we vote in the seven (previous motions against him). Why this time we do it differently, he asked. My view is that we have to do what we have done in the past, he told Parliament. He said the DA would not get the majority it wants by coaxing ANC MPs to vote with them. Politics and Development Hub
