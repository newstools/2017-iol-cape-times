Cape Town – A preliminary report from the Western Cape Provincial Traffic Services indicates that ten people died on the province’s roads over the weekend. The majority of these were pedestrians, including one child. Provincial traffic officers arrested 28 motorists for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol on June 2 and 3, 2017. Eight were arrested in the Caledon service area, five in Knysna, three in George, three in Swellendam, two in Brackenfell, two in Somerset West, two in Caledon, two in Worcester and one in Beaufort West. Breath testing was performed on 1 455 drivers at 22 alcohol blitz roadblocks across the province. The highest breath alcohol reading was recorded in the Mossel Bay service area. At 1.17 mg of alcohol/1 000 ml of breath, this is over four times the legal limit of 0.24 mg/1 000 ml. Four other persons were arrested: two for reckless and negligent driving in Mossel Bay and Somerset West; and two for false documentation in Knysna. A total of 74 speeding offences were recorded. A total of 202 fines in the amount of R241 900 were issued for a variety of reasons, ranging from driver offences to vehicle fitness violations. The highest speeds recorded were: 162 km/h in a 120 km/h zone in the Beaufort West service area; and 122 km/h in a 100 km/h zone in the Worcester service area. "Shorter, darker days, fog and rain during the Western Cape winter months hamper visibility and can increase the risk of a road traffic crash," provincial traffic chief Kenny Africa said. "Don't miss out on your future because you didn't see another road user, or weren't seen yourself. Travel more slowly when visibility is poor and the roads are wet. Wear visible clothing when you walk next to a road. If you are not seen on the road, you may not see your future."
