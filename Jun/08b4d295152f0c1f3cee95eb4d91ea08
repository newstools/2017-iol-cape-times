With the latest official suspension of Western Cape Premier Helen Zille from party activities; my understanding is effectively you are being told you are no longer fit to be a member of the DA. It also seems strange that no reasons or method or duration is given for your suspension. Politicians are generally very adept at seeing which way the wind is blowing and adjusting their sails accordingly. Playing the race card, according to Madiba, is one of the dumbest and weakest strategies to use. So please don’t play the race cards with your colleagues. Most of them were hand picked and endorsed by yourself. Many blacks had to “take a long walk on short plank” for their misdemeanours or bad calls. So I think the DA is beyond punishing or prejudicing whites for their race. It clearly seems that you have misjudged your colleagues and maybe as a result of your brilliant strategies you made the DA too good and too strong for your own good. The political life lines you threw to floundering politicians do not seem to have worked for you in your hour of need. If this was a Western Cape party/caucus this would not have occurred. SA is a bit more than the Western Cape and elections are fought nationally. You served the DA well and in turn the DA has given you great honour and a distinguished political career for which history will judge you favourably. The fact that you hold office by virtue of your party membership, the party you campaigned for and always emphasised on being a good democrat and abiding by your party’s decision; maybe it is time to resign and exit gracefully without any rancour.
