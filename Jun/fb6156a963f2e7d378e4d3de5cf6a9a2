Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) spokesperson, Robert Netshiunda, said the Richards Bay Organised Crime Unit, along with Crime Intelligence officers in Empangeni and Pretoria arrested three men following the discovery of heroin worth R104 million on Monday. "Members of the Pretoria Crime Intelligence had gathered information about a vehicle which was going to enter South Africa through the Kosi Bay Port of Entry with drugs," Netshiunda said. "The Task Team at the port of entry was immediately activated and the described vehicle was stopped and taken to a nearby police station for a thorough search." "Several bags of drugs which were allegedly fetched from Mozambique were found concealed inside a make-shift compartment underneath the vehicle. A 27-year-old man was immediately arrested." "Intensive investigations then led the Hawks to Gauteng where two foreign nationals, aged 24 and 29, years were arrested. They were found with R50 000 in cash." The two suspects were due to appear before the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday when their case would be transferred to the Emanguzi Magistrate's Court where would join their alleged accomplice for an appearance on Thursday.
