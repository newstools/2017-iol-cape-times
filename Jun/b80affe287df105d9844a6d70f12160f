President Jacob Zuma on Thursday said he was not stepping down and argued against a motion of no confidence in him being held by secret ballot. I m fit and doing it very well, Zuma said while answering questions from opposition MPs in the National Assembly. My political office was made by the ANC .. and the day it thinks I can t be president it would remove me, and it has not done so Zuma referred to a judgment by the Constitutional Court earlier in the day which placed a decision on whether a vote of no confidence would be held by secret ballot in the hands of Speaker Baleka Mbete. I see no convincing reason why you should change. In the manner in which we have done before, it has not been secret. We have instruments why don t we use it? You are trying to get a majority you do not have, Zuma said, mocking opposition parties.Zuma said the African National Congress would retake the municipalities it lost to opposition parties last year, and said the ruling party would emerge victorious during the general elections in two years time. In 2019 the ANC will win again because you don t have the majority. You can try, you can do everything, you can go to court, the court will bring you back to the legislature that s my answer. Zuma also rejected a question by Congress of the People MP Willie Madisha who asked Zuma whether he would respond to a call by the South African Council of Churches for fresh elections because the current government had lost its moral compass. The fact that the government or whatever has lost its moral whatever, that is not the view of the majority. The ANC was voted in by a huge majority since 1994. What he [Madisha] says is a creation that is being created in the minds of people like himself because they are in opposition. African News Agency (ANA)
