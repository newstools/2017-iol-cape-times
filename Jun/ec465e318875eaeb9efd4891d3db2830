The advert shows several collated video clips, where men - who are mostly white - do a myriad of positive activities with their children to celebrate yesterday’s Father’s Day. The video advert was captioned: “Happy #FathersDay to all amazing dads out there”. But Twitter users were scathing of the advert, arguing the campaign showed that only white men made good fathers. One user, Pholoho Selebano, wrote: “@OUTsurance first you raised R250000 for Knysna fires, but have never donated to the shack fire victims. Now an anti-Black fathers day ad (sic).” Peter Cronje, head of marketing at the insurance company, agreed that the advert was “demographically inappropriate”, and said it was an “innocent mistake” by a junior employee.  He said the Knysna money collected went to the majority black neighbourhoods of the town. One user sarcastically congratulated the company for turning what should have been a celebration of all fathers, into a celebration of white fathers.  This doesn't accurately represent FATHERS of all races in South Africa.

Celebrities also reacted to the video, with the likes of actress Rami Chuene posting a montage of pictures which could have been used to celebrate fathers.   Actor Hlomla Dandala also weighed in on the matter, saying the advert clearly demonstrated how fatherhood was clearly not a black thing.    When contacted for comment, Outsurance said it was aware of the post and has since apologised for the "offensive" advert. Some of the reactions to the advert:
