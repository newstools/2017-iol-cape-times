The teacher pulled up to fetch her husband from a local tavern. When they returned and were about to park the car, gunshots flared. She was shot in the head and died at the scene outside her car. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said two suspects had been arrested for the murder and would appear at the Bellville Magistrate’s Court tomorrow. A fellow teacher at her school, who fears being named, said her colleague had a great passion for 
teaching. “We have lost a real 
soldier.” A family member, who asked to remain anonymous as she had no mandate to speak on behalf of the family, said they had no idea who could have committed such an evil act. “She did not have any enemies. She was a people’s person and got along with everyone.” South African Democratic Teachers Union provincial secretary Jonovan Rustin sent condolences to the family and said he hoped that the law would take its course. Counsellors are expected to attend to traumatised pupils and teachers at Blomvlei Primary School in Hanover Park, where the victim worked, this week. Jessica Shelver, speaking on behalf of Education MEC Debbie Schäfer, said the department was made aware of the incident yesterday. “Our heartfelt condolences to the teachers, family, friends and school community,” said Shelver, adding that counselling would be provided, before directing further questions to police.
