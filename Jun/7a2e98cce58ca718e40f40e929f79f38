CRYSTAL August has been on a mission to help make the lives of cancer patients easier. And thanks to the public's contributions to her cause, she will be at Tygerberg Hospital on Tuesday to deliver c hemo care bags to 20 patients suffering side effects of chemotherapy and radiation. August &nbsp;started the initiative, Birthday of Hope (BOH), five years ago , which celebrates its anniversary on Tuesday. She said BOH is a platform to lend a helping hand, and give back to those less fortunate. &nbsp; Cancer patients at the Tygerberg Care Home, some of who spend anything between six to 12 weeks away from their families, will receive the packs. There is still time to donate to the Restoring Hope with Chemo Care bags campaign. People may contact August on 0721350274 or email [email&#160;protected] .[email&#160;protected]
