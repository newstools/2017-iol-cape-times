Following a rigorous evaluation process and the awarding of a venue safety certificate for Newlands by the City of Cape Town, the historic stadium will host the All Blacks for the first time since 2008 on October 7. The first Test match between the Springboks and All Blacks, at DHL Newlands, took place in 1928, with the All Blacks winning the ‘Umbrella Test’ 13-5. The Rugby Championship Test this year will be the 10th encounter between the two teams at the second oldest active Test venue in the world after Lansdowne Road. WP Rugby Group CEO Paul Zacks was delighted to confirm that the All Blacks will run out to face the Springboks at Newlands for the first time in nine years. “There has been a lot of hard work behind the scenes to ensure that we can enjoy the spectacle of the Springboks taking on the All Blacks at Newlands once more. We are all looking forward to what should be another thrilling contest,” he said. President of the Western Province Rugby Football Union, Thelo Wakefield, said that it is always a special occasion when the All Blacks visit Newlands. “The rivalry between the Springboks and the All Blacks is something special, so it is only fitting that it be played on the grand stage of Newlands once again. We are surely in for another classic encounter,” he said.
