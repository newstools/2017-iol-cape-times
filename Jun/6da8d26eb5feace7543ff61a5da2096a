The City’s Disaster Risk Management has warned that “due to the approaching cold front coinciding with a spring tide, wave heights in excess of 12 metres are expected along the coastal areas of the Cape Peninsula”.  JP Smith, the mayoral committee member for safety, security, and social services, had earlier cautioned residents along the Cape coastline to take extra precautions. “We recommend that the public stay away from the coastline, including the Sea Point Promenade. "Residents of areas right at the coast – such as Bakoven, Camps Bay Main Road, Slangkop, Kommetjie, Small and Big Bay in Blouberg, Melkbosstrand, Strand etc – might want to consider moving their cars to higher ground if they can. "It is key that the general public stays away from the coastal areas for their own safety.”  The sun briefly made its appearance on the Atlantic Seaboard on a stormy day, before the gloom descended once more after 1pm.
