A courrt battle to stop deductions from grant beneficiaries accounts may not be over.The SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) is studying the refusal of an appeal application in the North Gauteng High Court, involving amendments to the Social Assistance Act, and will decide on how to proceed. The case was brought following Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini announcing amendments last year to regulations 21 and 26A of the Social Assistance Act, which was that beneficiaries need to go to a Sassa office and give written permission for a deduction; only insurers registered under the Long-term Insurance Act of 1998 may offer funeral policies; no payments to brokers will be allowed; and funeral deductions from children's grants will also no longer be allowed.The interpretation and legality of the amendments were then challenged by Net 1, among others, and in May, the North Gauteng High Court found service providers can continue to deduct money from social grant accounts.The court found there is no distinction between social grant beneficiaries accounts held at Grindrod Bank and any other account held at another bank, and that the regulations do not operate to restrict beneficiaries in the operation of their bank account.This week, Black Sash Trust and social grant beneficiaries, represented by the Centre for Applied Legal Studies, argued for leave to appeal against that decision, but were refused.Agency spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi said: Sassa has noted with disappointment the judgment in the North Gauteng High Court where leave to appeal was refused.&quot;Sassa s legal team is currently studying the implications of the judgment with a view to exploring available options.&quot;Once a conclusion has been reached they will advise Sassa on appropriate options moving forward. About R550 million a month is paid into about 10 million beneficiaries bank accounts countrywide.Sassa provincial spokesperson Shivani Wahab said since the start of the year there had been 1&nbsp;097 unauthorised deductions in the Western Cape.Lynette Maart, Black Sash Trust's national director, said: We are disappointed by (the) outcome, especially given the Constitutional Court's March decision, which recognised that grant beneficiaries accounts do require special protection.&quot;We remain committed to protecting grant beneficiaries from exploitation and unlawful deductions from their social grants. Meanwhile, Sassa has budgeted R2m for the remuneration of the 10-member panel of experts appointed to monitor the phasing out of the Cash Paymaster Services contract.The agency wants the experts to tell them the reasonable amount that should be paid to them for overseeing the contract for the payment of social grants.During a briefing to the social development portfolio committee yesterday, Sassa said it did not know how the experts would be paid and said it would take its cue from the court.
