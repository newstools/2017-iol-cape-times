Gwangxu’s family joined thousands at the service at the Philippi East Community hall in Lower Cross Roads. Gwangxu’s colleague, Tandeka Gqada, who was with him when he was shot, said: “We are all in pain, it is just that our levels of pain are 
different.” Gqada said she was sitting in her car talking to Gwangxu when a man approached them, drew a firearm and shot Gwangxu once. “I want justice to be done. In order for us to get closure, we have to know what happened ,” she said. Premier Helen Zille told the mourners she would follow Gwangxu’s murder case until the perpetrator was arrested. ANC councillor Mboniswa Chitha described Gwangxu as a good man who intended to do his best for his community. Chitha said hours after Gwangxu was killed, some had accused him of the murder. “If I had anything or role to play in Xolile’s murder, then let the course of justice play its role. I am hurt by what happened to Xolile because he was advising me on many issues because he has been a leader long before me,” said Chitha. The DA chief whip in the city, Shaun  August, said Gwangxu worked tirelessly not only for the DA but to serve the whole of his 
community. “We feel his absence in the party,” said August. DA acting provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela said Gwangxu was an honest man. “Xolile would not tell you what you want to hear, but would tell you the truth. He loved his job. It is inevitable that as humans we must disagree, but our disagreements must not make us enemies,” said Madikizela. DA national leader Mmusi Maimane said the perpetrator “will pay the ultimate price”. “We are well within our rights to feel angry,” he said.
