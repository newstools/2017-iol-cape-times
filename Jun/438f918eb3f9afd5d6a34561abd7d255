Zuma was busy consulting with the lawyers on the matter, Ramaphosa told the National Assembly yesterday while answering questions. The next step would be to look at the modalities for the inquiry, while the terms of reference would determine the scope of work to be done, Ramaphosa said. The ANC has also come out in support of the inquiry into state capture. Ramaphosa said he was happy all the parties 
supported the establishment of the inquiry to get to the bottom of state capture in the country. He said there had been many stories flying around and it would be important for all those implicated to clear their name. Asked by Hlengiwe Hlophe of the EFF if he personally supported the commission of inquiry, he said he did. “Yes, I do. I have gone public about why I support the commission of inquiry. "I support the inquiry into this matter because there 
are allegations made all round. “Anybody who has any evidence should welcome the inquiry and present 
themselves. "It is important that those who are mentioned should clear their names.” He said it was important the country supported the inquiry in order to put the state capture issue to rest. Ramaphosa said the ANC was not trying to prolong the process by suggesting it should stretch back to 1994. This follows the decision of the party's national executive committee a few weeks ago. Ramaphosa said the ANC wanted the process to get to the bottom of the truth as “quick as possible”. He was happy that the Hawks had started to look at criminal cases on state capture, adding that in the end the truth would come out. The move followed the surfacing of a trove of emails implicating a number of top government officials, the Guptas and their associates in the running of state affairs.
