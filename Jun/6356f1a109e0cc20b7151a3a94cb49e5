"The Disaster Risk Management Centre continues its assessment of informal settlements to determine the extent to which people have been affected," Disaster Risk spokesperson Charlotte Powell said. "At last count, 97 dwellings were reported flooded in Macassar Village, leaving 400 people affected. The South African Red Cross Society is providing humanitarian relief, although no emergency shelter has been activated. "In Hout Bay, 362 dwellings were affected in Disa Park and Madiba Square. Emergency shelter has been activated in the Green Hall and NGO partner, HDI is providing humanitarian relief. "Other City departments are clearing away uprooted trees and other blockages that have occurred as a result of the rain and gale-force winds and attending to residents in Council-owned properties and those in informal settlements requiring assistance with damage to their structures."
