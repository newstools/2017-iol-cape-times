The City has reacted with shock after a minibus taxi was caught with 32 passengers – 14 of them standing.     The city says the  taxi driver had his vehicle impounded after a run-in with traffic officers  on June 15.  The driver was unlicensed and operating in contravention of his operating licence, which resulted in the automatic impoundment of the vehicle and his arrest, according to the City.  Safety and Security Mayco member JP Smith said: “This is an absolutely shocking incident. While I understand that there is immense pressure on the public transport system as well as the people who rely on it to get to work, there is no excuse for this type of behaviour. I shudder to think of the consequences if that vehicle had to be in a collision.  “I appeal to the public to please steer clear of overloaded vehicles, for their own safety and that of others. Incidents like these do nothing for the reputation of the taxi industry and so I also call on owners and associations to address this type of lawlessness.”
