More than 200 residents from Suurbraak and neighbouring towns joined land activists during a service delivery protest to the Swellendam Municipality at the weekend. This follows the activists protests along the Overberg town s main road for more than 50 days, where makeshift shacks were erected representing 20 years of unfulfilled promises for housing. Suurbraak Youth Movement leader Donovan Julius said: The people are tired of unfulfilled promises and the lack of services for our communities. Beyond the housing and pine forest issues, the youth still need programmes and a youth centre to help uplift themselves. He said there was an arrogance from the officials in dealing with the gripes of the community as they, including Swellendam Mayor Nicholas Myburgh, watched protests from the safety of the municipal building s high iron fences.Activist and resident Reinette Heunis said supporters, including Barrydale residents, joined them. We marched through the municipality that boasts it was voted the country s best-run municipality last year. Our aim is to show that this (Swellendam) municipality does not concern itself with the poorer communities they are mandated to serve, said Heunis.She said the community handed a memorandum of demands to the officials and gave them seven days to respond. Demands include basic service delivery, temporary housing for those affected by the recent storm, addressing the issue of land ownership and programmes for the youth.Heunis said Myburgh did not approach the crowds, and public order police were deployed to ensure a peaceful demonstration. She said the mayor had a responsibility to address the Suurbraak community directly, and provide answers on how the municipality justifies its expenditure in the former missionary town.Acting municipal manager Hennie Schlebusch confirmed the Suurbraak community s memorandum was received by the municipality. Attempts to contact Myburgh before deadline were unsuccessful. [email&#160;protected]
