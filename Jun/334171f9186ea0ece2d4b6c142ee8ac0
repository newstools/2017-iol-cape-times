The South African Renewable Energy Council (Sarec) says it is deeply disappointed that the Department of Energy and Eskom failed to provide certainty for investors during this week s update to Parliament on Eskom s failure to sign power purchase agreements with independent power producers (IPPs). Sarec says the inter-governmental task team has instead proposed further delays to the end of August, if not February 2018, which will have negative consequences for South Africa s renewables industry. Growing numbers of companies, employees, graduates and communities are suffering the consequences of R58 billion stalled investment, 13 000 lost construction jobs and billions of rand of local economic development spend forgone, Sarec said in a statement. The portfolio committee on energy this week called on Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and her counterparts in the Department of Energy to be clear about their plans for renewable energy.The departments were seen to be pushing more for nuclear energy while moving slowly on renewable energy. Brown assured Parliament that Eskom would sign the fourth window with independent power producers on renewable energy projects worth billions. This was the same assurance given by Deputy Energy Minister Thembi Majola to MPs on Tuesday following concerns by IPPs on the future of the projects.Brown told MPs there were processes being finalised by Eskom and the Department of Energy, including the review of the black industrialists programme, before signing new agreements.She said after all these processes they would sign into IPP projects.Sarec says before the renewables programme ground to a halt in 2015, it was trumpeted as a success by the government and Eskom. Bid tariffs had tumbled to the point where renewable energy has become the cheapest option for new generation capacity available to the country, and renewable plants are majority-owned by South Africans and typically built in rural areas where they bring unprecedented benefits to poor communities.Sarec chair Brenda Martin said: The industry had already attracted a substantial eco-system of service industries. The renewables industry has exceeded employment targets by 27%, more than 98% of renewable projects have been delivered on time, and all BEE and community ownership targets have been met, Sarec said.
