JOHANNESBURG – What a week this is turning out to be for Warren Whiteley! The Lions No 8 won’t only run out as the 58th Springbok captain on Saturday when he leads the national team for the first time against France in the first of three Test matches, but he will do so having become a father for the second time. Whiteley’s wife Felicity gave birth to baby Samuel on Monday morning, and according to the Golden Lions Rugby Union, “all is well with mother and baby”. Baby Samuel has an older sister, Ava, who is two years old. Whiteley was recently appointed Bok captain following the international retirement of Adriaan Strauss at the end of last season. The 29-year-old loose forward, who made his Test debut in 2014, will earn his 16th Test cap at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria on Saturday. The two other Tests against France are scheduled for Durban and Johannesburg.  Congrats to #Springbok captain@WarrenWhiteley and wife Felicity who welcomed baby Samuel to the family earlier today. #LoveRugby  — South African Rugby (@Springboks) June 5, 2017   @jacq_west IOL Sport   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
