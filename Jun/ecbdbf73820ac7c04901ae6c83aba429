A Kensington infant has become the latest victim of abuse after he died in hospital yesterday. Police say the stepfather of the 18-month-old boy will appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court today. The child's mother was taken in for questioning last night. “The Western Cape has been hit by yet another child murder. According to reports police responded to a complaint at a health facility in Kensington where health workers informed them of an 18-month-old boy who died. “The child had sustained serious injuries to the head and body. "The child's 26-year-old stepfather was arrested and his 30-year-old mother taken in for questioning. The suspect will appear in the Cape Town Magistrates' Court once charged,” said a police spokesperson. This comes as Protea Park resident Wilfred Oliphant appeared in Atlantis Magistrates' Court for the murders of Octavia, 22, and Cleo Skippers, 22. Oliphant, a 35-year-old married father of two, has been charged with the double murder. The victim's mother Lena Skippers and family members attended proceedings yesterday, supported by community members. “I had to see him and look into his eyes, see if this man who came into my home did this. Nothing can bring my child and granddaughter back. I just want the person responsible to be put away forever.” Oliphant is believed to be the last person to have seen the victims alive, said community activist and ward councillor Barbara Rass. She said the Atlantis community demand a thorough investigation into the murder and the suspect must be denied bail. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said: “The 35-year-old man is charged with the murders of Octavia and Cleo Skippers, and the matter has been postponed till July 14 for further investigation. "The accused hasn't applied for bail as yet, but the State will oppose his application at a later stage.” Anyone with information to the crime is urged to contact Atlantis police on 021 571 8576 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
