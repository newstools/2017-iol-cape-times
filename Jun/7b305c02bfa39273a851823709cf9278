Trade unions and students at Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) say vice-chancellor Prins Nevhutalu faces the axe for alleged fraud and corruption. The Cape Times understands a disciplinary hearing is under way against Nevhutalu. The last sitting of the hearing was on Thursday last week, according to sources at the university.The university s council had resolved in its November meeting last year to place Nevhutalu on special leave until Much 31. But he has yet to return to his position and Dr John Volmink has been appointed acting vice-chancellor. The university has remained mum about Nevhutalu s case. Spokesperson Lauren Kansley said she was not at liberty to comment on Nevhutalu s special leave. CPUT council member Benson Nqgentsu would also not comment, saying he did not have the mandate to do so and referred questions to registrar Nikile Ntsababa. Ntsababa said: We have a media liaison officer (Kansley) here at CPUT to deal with such matters. I am also in Mr Ngqentsu s position and not mandated to talk about such issues. But a student leader who requested his name be withheld told the Cape Times that a disciplinary hearing has been ongoing against Nevhutalu and its outcome was expected to be announced next month.He said the charges against Nevhutalu were based on the university s previous investigation which had cleared him last year. Members of #FeesMustFall (FMF) at CPUT had accused Nevhutalu of corruption, purging students who raised the allegations, and who were involved in protest action, refusing to insource services, sexual harassment, and refusing to write off student debt despite CPUT council s request.
