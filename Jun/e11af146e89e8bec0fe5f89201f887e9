A search led by the police and residents for Erin Fredericks had been launched. The area's Community Policing Forum had came out strongly against the police earlier this week, saying they had been handling the matter poorly. They said that they were not informed of the missing child. Erin, 15, was reported missing on June 14. She was reunited with her parents hours after a press briefing by her mother Margaret de Koker. De Koker and her ex-husband Ivan Fredericks made heartfelt appeals for help in finding their missing daughter. The press conference was initiated by Mitchells Plain Crisis Forum members after they had become aware of a WhatsApp group chat message, which De Koker supposedly received from the then missing Erin on Monday. The message had read: “Hey, I'm safe. Just tell my mom not to worry. "And please reply to tell me that everything is cool. I just needed some time to think. "Tell my mom I love her.” At the press conference a sceptical and teary De Koker had said: “That message does not make sense to me. "It's not cool at all, because no one knows where she is. “I get the feeling she is being threatened and used for prostitution. "The feeling I have is that she is kept somewhere and can't get out.” Asked about how she felt about her daughter's disappearance, De Koker had replied that she felt both alive and dead. She had implored Erin to come home. “I love my daughter. "Whatever she asked I gave her. "Sometimes she made me cross.” At the time of her disappearance, Erin had been visiting and sleeping over at her father's house. De Koker said she and Fredericks has been divorced for the past 19 years Fredericks said the reason why he failed to report Erin’s disappearance for the three weeks that she had been missing was because Erin was “naughty”. She had previously disappeared from home “too many times”, Fredericks said.
