Crisis Medical paramedics were called to the scene near to the Queen Nandi Drive intersection at about 5am on Saturday, Crisis Medical said in a statement. "Reports from the scene suggest that the driver of a Volkswagen Polo hatchback lost control of the vehicle at high speed while travelling on the southbound side, causing the vehicle to careen across the center median before colliding head-on with a minibus taxi on the northbound side of the roadway. "Eye witness reports allege the driver of the Volkswagen fled the scene on foot in an unknown direction shortly after the collision." Twelve commuters in the minibus taxi sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate, with one commuter having sustained fatal injuries, and unfortunately being declared dead on arrival of paramedics.
