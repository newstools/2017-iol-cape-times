The EFF has threatened to report the Guptas and top government officials to the inspector-general of intelligence, Sethlomamaru Dintwe, alleging that its leader, Julius Malema, has been spied on by the family. This followed weekend reports that Malema and bank executives had been spied on by the Guptas over the last three years. EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi yesterday said the Guptas would not have had personal details on Malema and his movements inside and outside the country without the assistance of the departments of State Security and Home Affairs. He said the recent e-mail leaks had confirmed what they knew all along. We shall be taking the evidence as found in the leaked e-mails to the inspector-general of intelligence. We want to further warn the Guptas that we are also not going to sit by and allow them leverage over our leader s life, said Ndlozi.He added that the EFF did not think the Guptas would have had detailed information on Malema without the help of the State Security Agency and Home Affairs.The spokesman for the Department of State Security, Brian Dube, said Malema should lodge a complaint with the inspector-general of intelligence.Home Affairs spokesman David Hlabane said the matter would require an investigation.However, it was not only the department that had people's personal information, he said. This is not a matter that can be concluded without an investigation. It s not only Home Affairs that will be privy to details of people travelling in and out of the country. If people travel, they travel through travel agents, he said.He said Home Affairs would have details on the tickets.Hlabane said there were clear regulations and guidelines that governed the conduct of Home Affairs officials.The department would not disclose personal information about individuals to third parties, he said.He added that an investigation would help get to the bottom of this.The spokesman for the Gupta family, Gary Naidoo, had not responded by the time of publication.The Department of Home Affairs is tomorrow expected to appear before the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs on the naturalisation of Gupta family members.The meeting was postponed last week after Home Affairs Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize and the director, Mkuseli Apleni, failed to arrive.MPs in the committee wanted former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba to appear at the meeting to explain the processes followed after it emerged the Gupta family's applications had been expedited and Parliament had not been informed.
