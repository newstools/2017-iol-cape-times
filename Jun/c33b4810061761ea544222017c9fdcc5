Cape Town - A producer for the investigative series on MNET, Carte Blanche, was killed in a late night armed robbery on Wednesday at the Zebra Inn in Johannesburg’s Maboneng district. Johann Botha’s death has been described as a “devastating loss” by the programme’s executive producer George Mazarakis. Mazarakis said his death was not just an immense loss to Carte Blanche, but to the television industry as a whole. “He was highly experienced and talented, he was the executive producer of 50/50 before us and was also a presenter in his time. It’s an unquantifiable loss, you just don’t find people with that experience and talent.” Mazarakis said Botha was famous for being passionate about wildlife, and was also an opera singer. “He was a man of considerable depth who was an intellectual and committed to his work. He was warm and kind and enormous, but gentle.” Botha had an extensive CV and also worked on KykNet’s Projek Aardwolf. – African News Agency (ANA)
