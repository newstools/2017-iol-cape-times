Outsurance has blamed a junior employee for the anti-Black Father s Day social media advert that backfired on the company after it caused a furore on social media.The advert shows several collated video clips, where men - who are mostly white - do a myriad of positive activities with their children to celebrate yesterday s Father s Day. The video advert was captioned: Happy #FathersDay to all amazing dads out there . But Twitter users were scathing of the advert, arguing the campaign showed that only white men made good fathers.One user, Pholoho Selebano, wrote: [email&#160;protected] first you raised R250000 for Knysna fires, but have never donated to the shack fire victims. Now an anti-Black fathers day ad (sic). Peter Cronje, head of marketing at the insurance company, agreed that the advert was demographically inappropriate , and said it was an innocent mistake by a junior employee. This is @OUTsurance wishing a Happy Father's day toFathers out there.
