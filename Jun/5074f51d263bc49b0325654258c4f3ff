The Kleinvlei Community Policing Forum (CPF) says a breakdown in relations between police and CPFs is on the increase within the province.Kleinvlei CPF chairperson Julian Unthank slammed the police, saying there was a lack of commitment from their side to be more forthcoming in communication to CPFs. There are more and more instances of this happening across the province, and in many instances the relationships have broken down. We understand police have protocol but the relationship with the community is vital in fighting the scourge of crime, said Unthank.This comes as Grassy Park CPF spokesperson Phillip Bam slated the police for poorly handling the disappearance of 15-year-old Erin Fredericks.Bam said the delay in communication from the police was a regular occurrence and had they been informed sooner, they could have assisted searches sooner.The provincial CPF board chairperson, Andrew Lyon, said the role of the CPFs had never been defined clearly. There exists a uniform CPF constitution for the province, but it has never really been defined and in some instances it clashes with SAPS's own internal protocol. A need for oversight has also never fully been adopted as this is viewed as giving a certain level of power to CPFs over the police, said Lyon.He said the relationship is only as strong as the attitude and commitment to serve the communities that elect their CPF representatives. The challenges both found within the internal policing structures as well as the socio-economic conditions of many communities play a part. While some communities have better relationships with their police, others do not and there must be more emphasis from both sides to mend this, said Lyon.A breakdown in communication and relations would only be to the detriment of the communities.Police spokesperson Novela Potelwa said the SAPS strove to engage all sectors of society. Police remained committed to building strong partnerships with the CPFs in an effort to defeat crime.
