Cape Town - Cameron Wilson stood smiling in the Cape Town High Court’s dock on Friday morning when Judge Chantel Fortuin handed down a guilty verdict on 13 charges. Wilson, 20, from Heinz Park, faced 15 charges including five counts of murder, four counts of attempted murder, two counts of assault and rape, one count of the possession of an illegal firearm and one count of the possession of illegal ammunition. Wilson was arrested in September in connection with the murder of 18-year-old Lekita Moore in Valhalla Park while he was out on bail for the murder of Stacey Lee Mohale in April 2015. Moore was stabbed 98 times and her mutilated, naked body was discovered in an open field in Tuna Road next to the 8ste Laan informal settlement. Wilson was found guilty on all murder charges, but received a not guilty verdict for the rape of Stacey Lee Mohale, 16, who was brutally murdered in April 2015 and the attempted murder of Cody Philander.
