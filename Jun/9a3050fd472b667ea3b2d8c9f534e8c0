South Africa could do away with supplementary exams in March if the Department of Basic Education implements its plan to merge them with June exams. The department will appear before the portfolio committee on basic education tomorrow. This follows the agreement between the Department of Higher Education and Basic Education in 2014 to merge the exams. The Department of Basic Education wants its plan to be operational by 2020. Chairperson of the portfolio committee on basic education Nomalugelo Gina said having three Matric exams does not work. She said students who write supplementary exams in March are more disadvantaged than people who sit for their exams in June or November. Those who write in March only have a month to prepare after results are released in January. The Department of Basic Education has learnt that out of 124 000 pupils who registered for supplementary exams in 2016/17, a total of 76 000 pupils sat for their exams. However, few students did well and got good results. They believe the merger of the exams will improve the situation. The other concern that the department has is that pupils who write their supplementary exams in March do not have access to higher education institutions in the same year. A merger will resolve the problem. The department added that the scrapping of the March supplementary exams will save it money and other resources. Instead of three exams a year the department would have two exams, in June and November, and this will be cost-effective. The department believes that no one will be disadvantaged by having two exams a year.
