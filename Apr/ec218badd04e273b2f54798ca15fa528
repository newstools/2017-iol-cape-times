Mashaba met Ipid head Robert McBride on Monday to request an investigation into allegations of abuse of power and defeating the ends of justice by Ntlemeza. This followed serious allegations being brought forward of Ntlemeza interfering in criminal investigations reported by the city, Mashaba said yesterday. “This includes an instruction made to all members involved in such investigations to no longer pursue such cases, nor arrest suspects. Further, threats of surveillance and monitoring were made against members who investigate our matters.” Given the gravity of these allegations, he said he had sought Ipid’s intervention. “We cannot allow political interests to interfere in our fight against corruption.” The complaint had also been forwarded to Police Minister Fikile Mbalula and Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane. The allegations of interference, he said, were backed up by the number of cases where investigations were completed but no further action had been taken, while in other cases warrants of arrests had been obtained but not executed. “We must ensure that those found guilty of corruption are put behind bars and stolen money returned to the people of this city,” Mashaba said. Since taking office in August last year, Mashaba’s administration has initiated corruption investigations into various departments. These have led to several arrests. Hawks spokesperson Robert Netshiunda described the allegations as “pure nonsense” and advised Mashaba to “shut up and run the municipality”, and allow the Hawks to conduct probes. “Ntlemeza has no reason to interfere in any investigation. We have been investigating in so many municipalities and people have been arrested - even in his municipality,” Netshiunda said. Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini confirmed receiving Mashaba’s complaint. “The Ipid requested specific details for it to assess which of those complaints fall within its mandate and in order to investigate, where it has a mandate.”
