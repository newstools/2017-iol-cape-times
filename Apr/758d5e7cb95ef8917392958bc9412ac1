A Philippi traditional healer was shot dead, and his 3-year-old son is fighting for his life in hospital after a gunman burst through the door of their two-roomed shack and opened fire. Nozuko Mapeyi yesterday said she moved with her husband, Sebenzile Mtshungwana, 36, to Sweet Home Farms informal settlement from Khayelitsha a few months ago. She had also been in the shack when the gunman opened fire on Sunday, but survived. She remains shaken, and shocked at the tragedy which has befallen her family. Her son Ayabulela was taken to the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital intensive-care unit. Police spokesperson Andre Traut confirmed the incident, and said no arrests had been made. Yesterday, Mapeyi said she was resting on her bed, while her husband, two other men along with her son were in the living room, when a man stormed into the home and started shooting randomly. Before the shooting, according to Mapeyi, a man asked her husband for a jacket, after which he left. A few minutes later her husband and son were shot. “At first I thought the (sound of the) gunshots were an exploding electrical box, until my son shouted that he and his father had been shot. "My body got numb and it became dark, although the light was on. It was a scary experience,” she said, weeping uncontrollably. She says she tried calling out for help when the gunman ran away, but she was too stunned. Ntshungwana’s brother Themba Plaatjie said what happened was very sad. “The child is in a very critical condition and we pray for his survival.” He said the circumstances related to the shooting were not clear, but hoped that police would investigate and bring the suspect to justice. Describing his brother, Tshungwana said he was a nice person who would "not even hurt a fly".  sandiso.phaliso@inl.co.za
