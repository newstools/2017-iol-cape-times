Khaya Thobela, who was also the Speaker of the Umzimkhulu Municipality, was shot repeatedly on his arrival at his home in Mfundweni Village on Thursday night. He died in an undisclosed hospital yesterday. The ANC provincial leadership visited Thobela’s family yesterday. “Although branches are still to nominate candidates, it is known that Thobela was looking at becoming the next regional secretary,” said a source within the ANC. However, the ANC secretary in Harry Gwala Region, Sindi Msomi, could not confirm what position Thobela was contesting since branches had not nominated candidates for the conference, which will take place in June. Msomi said that although there was political tension in the region due to the conference, she could not say whether Thobela’s murder was linked. “I would not know whether he was standing for any position because the branch general meetings have not met to nominate candidates, and also we will only know when people are asked during the conference whether they are contesting or not,” she said. Msomi said although she did not know whether Thobela’s life had been threatened, several political leaders in the Harry Gwala region had been given extra guards after security assessments. “The deputy mayor of Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma Municipality, Philani Shange, is under state protection because shots were fired at him last year," she said.
