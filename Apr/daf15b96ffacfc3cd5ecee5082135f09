PC Petersen Primary in Kylemore, Stellenbosch, has unveiled an office donated by the Cape Wine Auction Trust in association with the Community Keepers. The trust, which consists of some of Stellenbosch’s premier winemakers, helped with the conversion of a classroom into the office. PC Petersen principal Shu-aib September said the office would be immensely beneficial. Former Springbok captain and investment firm Citadel’s philanthropy head, Jean de Villiers, said Citadel supported initiatives which aided less fortunate communities.
