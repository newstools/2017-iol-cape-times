The MK Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) in KwaZulu-Natal has promised to send 600 of its “combat-ready” members to Luthuli House to defend the ANC headquarters against what it calls “enemy forces”. While refusing to divulge whether these MKMVA members will be armed, its provincial chairperson, Themba Mavundla said they would do everything in their power, including laying down their lives, in defence of the ANC and its president. “We’re soldiers, not karatekas (practitioners of karate). We know only one thing,” he said when asked how the MKMVA would defend the ANC. The statement was a response to earlier plans by the DA to march to the ANC headquarters to put pressure on President Jacob Zuma to resign. The march to Luthuli House was, however, later cancelled. Mavundla said any march to Luthuli House was an act of provocation. “As much as we detest the DA, we have never marched to their offices, and so no one must come and play at Luthuli House. If they want to come to Luthuli House, they must come but they should know it will not be nice.” Earlier in the week, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi cautioned opposition parties against marches to Luthuli House, saying they could spark violence. The staunch Zuma supporters said they viewed the protests as not only an attack on Zuma, but a calculated move meant to weaken the ANC. “To destroy the ANC you must attack its head, so President Zuma is a strategic hill. The real target is the ANC.” The military veterans also took aim at some ANC members and leaders who have publicly voiced their dissatisfaction with Zuma, saying these members had become “unpaid supporters of the enemy forces”. “We were shocked when our comrades took over the programme of the DA of wanting to divide, destroy and annihilate our time-tested movement. They literally sold their souls and abandoned our national revolution for a small fame in the anti-government media.”
