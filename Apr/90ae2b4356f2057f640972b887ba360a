Ntlemeza’s lawyer, Comfort Ngidi, said yesterday that his client would be at his desk today. This followed their filing of papers in the Supreme Court of Appeal. Ngidi said there was nothing in law that prevented Ntlemeza from returning to work. “What I can tell you that our client is going to work tomorrow (today) because the matter is a subject of appeal,” said Ngidi. Spokesperson for the Hawks, Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi, referred enquiries to Police Minister Fikile Mbalula's office. Mbalula’s spokesperson, Vuyo Mhaga, said they did not want to speculate on what Ntlemeza would or would not do today. He said they were guided by the decision of the High Court in Pretoria, which axed Ntlemeza. “It was not our decision that Ntlemeza is not the head of the Hawks, and it is not out of malice; it was the decision of the court,” said Mhaga. He said their job was to implement the decision, and that they would not back down. Ntlemeza threatened to return to his job last week, but later said he was still on holiday in the Eastern Cape and would be back today. Mhaga also said at the time that there was a new head of the Hawks, Yolisa Matakata, and she would continue acting in the position. Mbalula had also indicated after he appointed Matakata that he wanted to appoint a permanent head of the Hawks before the end of the year. This position was also communicated by the portfolio committee on police. The two courts found that Ntlemeza's appointment was illegal and unlawful, and must be set aside. He went to the Supreme Court of Appeal last week. Ngidi confirmed that they had filed papers with the SCA, and said they would wait for the hearing.
