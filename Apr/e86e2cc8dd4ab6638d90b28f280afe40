Ngidi’s comment flies in the face of last week’s ruling by the Pretoria High Court that Ntlemeza be removed immediately as the Hawks boss. Ntlemeza has dug in his heels, saying only Parliament could fire him. Speaking to Independent Media yesterday, Ngidi said Ntlemeza would report for duty on Monday next week as he was taking the matter to the Supreme Court of Appeal. However, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula, who has already appointed Ntlemeza’s replacement, Lieutenant-General Yolisa Matakata, has reportedly called on Ntlemeza to respect his decision to sack him, saying he must vacate in peace. It was reported that a showdown would loom between Mbalula and Ntlemeza if the latter reported for duty. Unperturbed, Ngadi said: “If we experience any challenges when General Ntlemeza returns to work, we will then consider what legal remedies we have in order to ensure that he executes his duties.” Mbalula’s spokesperson, Vuyo Mhaga, said on Monday: “What we know is that there is a new head of the Hawks (Matakata) and she is busy executing her duty.”
