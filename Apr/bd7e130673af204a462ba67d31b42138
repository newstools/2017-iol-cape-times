State advocate Billy Downer said Lamoer and his co-accused – business owner Saleem Dawjee and three brigadiers, Darius van der Ross, Kollin Govender and his wife Sharon Govender – are accused of taking money and expensive gifts from Dawjee in exchange for special treatment. Downer quoted the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act saying that the “mere offer of gratification is the same crime as receiving or giving gratification”. Lamoer pleaded not guilty to all the charges brought against him, adding in his plea explanation, presented by defence lawyer Grant Smith, that Dawjee and he had been friends for “well over two decades”. “I may venture to suggest that he is in fact my best friend and that our relationship had grown through the hardships and successes we have both encountered in our personal, business and family lives.” Lamoer said his prosecution by the State “contains an element of ulterior motive” suggesting that he is being “witch-hunted”. He admitted that he received money from Dawjee but justified that by  saying the deposits received included a “wedding gift” to his daughter. “(It was) merely received on her behalf and in a manner exercising logistical convenience. At the time he did not have my daughter’s banking details and arranged for the funds to be deposited into my account,” Lamoer stated. According to Lamoer, he was “somewhat surprised” by the deposit made into his account by Dawjee. “I believe (Dawjee) at the time did not have my daughter’s banking particulars and arranged for the funds to be deposited into my account,” Lamoer said. Lamoer added that clothing accounts were paid on his behalf by Dawjee from his credit card, but said the money was paid back as Dawjee needed cash on the day. Lamoer denied having done any favours to any person while holding office as lieutenant general in the police service. The case continues today.
