The Ghanaian had been hiking in Platteklip Gorge at the time of her disappearance. Many hikers traverse the rocky terrain of Platteklip Gorge daily. For Nikoi’s family the trail is a painful reminder of her disappearance. Dessie Rechner, spokesperson of The Pink Ladies, an organisation of volunteers more usually involved with reuniting missing and endangered children with their families, has again urged the public to come forward with any information that would assist in locating Nikoi. “We have searched the mountain extensively and we have done everything that we possibly can, but we’ll need the public to come on board,” Reichner said. She said there had been no updates since the announcement of a R50000 reward for anyone who had any information about Nikoi’s whereabouts. Western Cape police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said there had been no leads and that the investigation was 
continuing.
