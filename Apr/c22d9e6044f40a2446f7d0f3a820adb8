The environmental group last week mobilised the community and delivered a memorandum to mayor Conrad Poole, demanding that the project be halted. In a statement, the municipality said the information published by the group was not representative of the facts. “On Wednesday, March 29, an activist group, that included DEW, took to the streets of Wellington and expressed their concerns surrounding the municipality’s waste-to-energy project. "The group has been persistent in publicising points surrounding the environmental and health impacts associated with incineration, which is based on outdated and incorrect information,” the release stated. The municipality said the technology involved made the WTE project “an environmentally sound solution” to the town’s depleting landfill situation. However, DEW chair-
person Bernus van der Westhuizen said they
were outraged by the “dishonest statements” made by the Drakenstein Municipality. “The officials are only trying to distract the public by discrediting us from their flawed and illegal tender process as confirmed by Local Government MEC Anton Bredell. "More than 2000 people came to join us in protest,” according to Van der Westhuizen. He said another omission by the municipality was that Drakenstein’s waste could provide 40% of the “fuel” the WTE requires to produce the amount of electricity claimed. Drakenstein municipal manager Dr Johan Leibbrandt said they would act in the community's best interests.
