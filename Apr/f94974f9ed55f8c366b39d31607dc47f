The DA’s federal legal commission head Glynnis Breytenbach said the charges against Zille deal with “bringing the party into disrepute and damaging the party”. While waiting to board a plane last month, after spending a week in Singapore and Japan, Zille tweeted in sequence: “For those claiming legacy of colonialism was only negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport infrastructure, piped water, etc.” “Would we have had a transition into specialised health care and medication without colonial influence? Just be honest, please. Getting on to an aeroplane now and won’t get on to the wi-fi, so that I can cut off those who think EVERY aspect of colonial legacy was bad.”  “I apologise unreservedly for a tweet that may have come across as a defence of colonialism. It was not.” The EFF branded her “a cold-hearted racist”. DA leader Mmusi Maimane tweeted: “Let’s make this clear: colonialism, like apartheid, was a system of oppression and subjugation. It can never be justified.” Zille has since apologised. Last month, Breytenbach met  Zille to determine whether disciplinary action would be taken against her. “A report was submitted to the (DA) federal executive after my interview and now the charges have been framed,” Breytenbach said yesterday. A date for the disciplinary hearing has yet to be set.
