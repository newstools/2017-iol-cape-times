The fire started late on Monday, resulting in road closures as firefighters and emergency services arrived on the scene to battle the flames in Russel Street. Breede Valley Municipality fire chief Theo Botha said eight fire engines, seven support vehicles and 40 firefighters assisted at the scene of the fire. The fire department, with assistance from the Cape Winelands District Municipality and medical support services - ER, Med Life and EMS - were deployed. “They succeeded in preventing two thirds of the building, including Shoprite, from burning down but unfortunately five stores in the centre were destroyed,” Botha said. He added that extensive smoke and heat damage had occurred within the shopping centre and a few surrounding buildings. “The cause and the extent of the fire is under investigation by the authorities. "There were no serious injuries or loss of life reported to the officials on duty,” Botha said. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk confirmed that the Worcester police had received an anonymous call alerting them to the fire. “A case of arson has been registered for police investigation and estimated cost of the damage is still unknown,” Van Wyk said. Shoprite issued a statement confirming their staff would temporarily be transferred to other stores in Worcester, until the Russel Street centre store reopened. A structural engineer was granted access to the supermarket and a full assessment regarding the cause and extent of the damage is expected, read the statement.
