Cape Town – Suspended ANC Western Cape chairperson Marius Fransman says the party’s national disciplinary committee (NDC) is “ biased and cannot be trusted”. His comments follow the the ANC’s national disciplinary committee of appeal’s (NDCA) decision to refer Fransman’s case back to the NDC. The NDC had found Fransman guilty on two counts of misconduct – one for abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand, and another for making public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute. Fransman then appealed the NDC’s decision to the party’s disciplinary committee of appeal for a review of the finding, arguing that the NDC did not consider the technical point on procedure. The party’s NDC had last year found both charges to be “very serious” and suspended his ANC membership for five years. It was reported that Wynand was allegedly “forced” to sleep next to Fransman in Kimberley while they were staying at a hotel during their visit to celebrate the ANC birthday bash . Fransman allegedly touched her while two others were seated in the back of the vehicle. During a press briefing at the ANC's provincial headquarters in Sahara House on Monday, Fransman said former NDC chairperson Derek Hanekom was among the people who wanted him out But ANC spokesperson Khusela Sangoni said the party will issue a statement about Fransman’s matter. “Derek Hanekom has now been found wanting, sitting in a Provincial Executive Committee meeting on Saturday and trying to get (the) Dullah Omar (region) to be dissolved. He has been found wanting, working with opposition parties like the Save South African try and embarrass the president,” he said. Fransman also slammed some members of the appeals committee headed by national committee member Jeff Radebe, saying some of them had embarrassed the party by speaking publicly against their colleagues in Cabinet as well as against President Jacob Zuma. * Read the full story in Tuesday's Cape Times
