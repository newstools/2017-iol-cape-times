Professor Tim Noakes' defence team argued at the resumed hearing into his professional conduct that no harm has come from his tweet advising a mom to wean her baby onto a low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet, but instead the ‘banting’ advocate is being prosecuted for being “unconventional”. Noakes, who has over 85 000 Twitter followers, has been accused of  acting unprofessionally by advising Pippa Leenstra to wean her baby onto a LCHF diet three years ago. The hearing continues tomorrow.   To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
