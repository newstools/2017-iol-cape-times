Parliament on Tuesday revealed the hijacking and brutal assault of a National Council of Provinces MP at the weekend. In a statement, South Africa’s national legislature condemned the attack on Simphiwe George Mthimunye, who was recovering at home in Mpumalanga following his harrowing ordeal. “Mr. Mthimunye was accosted by four men on foot while he parked outside his brother’s home at 20:30. He was forced into the back seat of his own vehicle and taken to a veld, where the would-be robbers tortured him for hours. “The men then made off with his valuable possessions, which include a vehicle, cellphones and bank cards. A case was laid at the Nkangala Police Station by Mr. Mthimunye.” Parliament wished him a speedy recovery. African News Agency
