Singer Caely Jo Levy’s solo performance at this year’s Yom HaShoah (Holocaust commemoration) will be a significant milestone after a decade of exclusion of female singers at the ceremony. The performance at the Pinelands Jewish cemetery on Sunday comes after a section of the Jewish community approached the Equality Court last year about the law forbidding Jewish women from singing at the ceremony. Fittingly, Levy will sing a Yiddish song, Mir lebn eybik (We Will Endure), composed by Vilna poet Leyb Rosenthal, who was murdered in the Klooga concentration camp in Estonia. The South African Centre for Religious Equality and Diversity (Sacred) head Julia Margolis said a woman singing at the ceremony should be unremarkable, but she was thrilled sanity triumphed. Sacred joined Gilad Stern and Sarah Goldstein in lodging papers at the Equality Court against the Cape SA Jewish Board of Deputies’ Holocaust ceremony ban on women.
