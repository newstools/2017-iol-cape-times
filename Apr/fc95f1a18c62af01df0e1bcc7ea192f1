The Bellville Velodrome was a hive of activities with senior citizens participating in athletics and walking. Mfuleni resident Dinah Stemela, 78, said she felt excited about participating in the event. “I suffer from high blood pressure and bone disease but this afternoon I’m feeling healthy and strong because of the games that I participated in” said Stemela. Mayor Patricia de Lille also participated and said they took great pride to honour the “fathers and mothers of this city”. “We also have a dedicated programme for older people so that we can encourage you to live healthy and active lifestyles. We have more than 270 home-based carers who are helping us to look after you,” said De Lille She told the gathering her office had some wheelchairs and commodes available. “If you or someone you know is in need of this equipment, you can just approach your local ward councillor or area-based mayoral committee member and ask them to make contact with my office. We will even have it delivered,” said De Lille.
