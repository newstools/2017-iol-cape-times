CAPE TOWN – After back-to-back defeats, South Africa’s Blitzboks bounced back to win their fifth-place semi-final 19-14 against Fiji at the Singapore Sevens on Sunday. Early in the match, Fiji’s Isake Katonibau was red-carded for a dangerous high tackle, but that did not deter the Islanders, who managed to gain a 14-7 lead by the halftime break. However, the South Africans used their one-man advantage to good effect in the second half to clinch the match 19-14 with two unanswered tries to take revenge after losing to the Fijians in the Hong Kong Cup final last weekend. The Blitzboks scored tries through Cecil Afrika (2) and Siviwe Soyizwapi, two of which Branco du Preez converted. Waisea Nacuqu scored a brace for Fiji and Osea Kolinisau was on target with both conversions. The Blitzboks will go on to meet New Zealand, who defeated Kenya in the other fifth-place semi-final, in the fifth-place playoff at 1.41pm SA time on Sunday. Earlier, the Philip Snyman’s team were knocked out by Australia in the Cup quarter-finals, going down 19-17. On Saturday, the Blitzboks lost to England in their final Pool B match. After a succession of upset results, unfancied teams USA and Canada will contest the Cup final at 2.30pm SA time on Sunday.
