NSRI Bakoven duty crew were called in just before 10am following reports of a rubber duck capsizing off Clifton 1st Beach with two people on board, the NSRI Bakoven duty coxswain, Mark Thompson, said. NSRI Bakoven launched a sea rescue craft, as did NSRI Table Bay, which launched two rescue boats. The NSRI shore crew, the policeâ€™s dive unit, the Western Cape government health emergency medical services (EMS), Life Healthcare paramedics, the NSRI Air Sea Rescue (ASR) and the AMS/EMS Skymed rescue helicopter, plus Clifton Surf Lifesaving lifeguards, all responded. The skipper of the rubber duck was found safe on the beach. He  confirmed that his 34-year-old crewman was missing in the surf after their boat capsized in heavy swells about 200m off 1st Beach. During an extensive air, sea and shoreline search in heavy swells and breaking surf, members of the public spotted the missing man in the surf-line at Clifton 4th Beach. The rescue services recovered his body. Police have opened an inquest docket and the South African Maritime Safety Authority (Samsa) will investigate the incident. Thompson said it appeared that the crew of the rubber duck was on stand-by for a private Clifton swim after launching earlier at Oceana Power Boat Club before capsizing in the surf line off Clifton 1st Beach. NSRI Table Bay was assisting to recover the rubber duck from the beach and would tow the boat to Oceana Power Boat Club, he said.
