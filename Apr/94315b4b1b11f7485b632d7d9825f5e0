Written by Thobani Nzuza and Kagiso Tsimakwane, the powerful drama examines the  implications of decisions taken by individuals and the possible devastating impact those decisions can have on future generations. Nzuza’s performance is enhanced by the live music created by Nhlanhla Zondi. Nzuza received the Best Actor award at the seventh annual Zabalaza Theatre Festival, which was held last month, showcasing 50 productions from the Western Cape and other regions. As part of its commitment to development, the Best of Zabalaza production winner receives a full run and the opportunity to be staged to a wider audience. Boy Ntulikazi is KwaZulu-Natal's first Best of Zabalaza winner. The play was originally performed at the Isigcawu Festival in Durban where Nzuza received the Best Actor award, followed by the Imbewu Festival, the Durban University of Technology New Playwrights’ Festival, the Uhuru Festival, the 2016 National Arts Festival in Grahamstown and at the Joburg Theatre. Ubuntu and care for future generations are at the heart of this story, where the decisions of parents are pivotal themes in a young man’s journey to find his biological mother.
