While no one would deny the economic success of Singapore, the state has adopted approaches more compatible with dictatorships than with desirable democratic role models (post-colonial or otherwise). Freedom of speech, among other cornerstones of freedom per se, has been severely curtailed throughout the rule of the People’s Action Party (PAP), one of whose founders was the iconic Lee Kuan Yew. Lee’s son, Brigadier Lee Hsien Loong, is the current prime minister. During the elder Lee’s decades-long tenure, distribution of several international publications, such as the Far Eastern Economic Review, was restricted or banned outright. State-controlled enterprises dominate the print and television media in Singapore, and despite a façade of openness and modernity, there are aggressive laws designed to attack dissent, such as the Sedition Act and the notorious Internal Security Act (ISA), which among other things allows for detention without trial - does that ring any bells, Ms Zille? In conclusion, while Singapore is undeniably a model of glitz and glamour, and indeed of economic success, it is a very dark place indeed for anyone who disagrees with its government. I am surprised at Zille’s naivete in using Singapore as an example of post-colonial advantage. Indeed, Singapore inherited its security laws, including detention without trial, from the former British colonists. Is that an example of the colonial legacies Ms Zille is advocating?
