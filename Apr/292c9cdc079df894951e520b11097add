This year’s Freedom Day will focus on the fight against crime under the banner, The Year of Oliver Reginald Tambo: Together deepening democracy and building safer and crime-free communities. Today, the Department of Arts and Culture will host a social dialogue at the Tribal Court in the uMhlabuyalingana Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, to tackle the root causes of crime and violence in the community. President Jacob Zuma is expected to lead celebrations in Manguzi, KwaZulu-Natal, tomorrow, which will reflect on the achievements that the country has had since 1994, while also reflecting on work that still needs to be done in building a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous country. The Presidency said in a statement that the day would also celebrate the contribution of former ANC president and national hero Tambo, who would have turned 100 this year. “We have heard the cry of many, especially the youth who are jobless. ‘Some have degrees, diplomas and technical certificates. They have also said they are tired of co-existing with crime in many communities. "We want to unite the country around building safer communities, while also continuing to address poverty, inequality and unemployment,” Zuma said. The Electoral Commission has also partnered with the Department of Basic Education to host the 5th annual Schools Democracy Week programme to educate young people about electoral democracy. The initiative, first held in 2013, has been rolled out at selected public schools, including in the Western Cape.
