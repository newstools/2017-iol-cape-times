Authors Naomi Lince-Deroche, Tamara Fetters, Edina Sinanovic, Jaymala Devjee, Jack Moodley and Kelly Blanchard completed their studies in support of the introduction and scale up of medication abortion. They published the studies “The costs and cost effectiveness of providing first-trimester, medical and surgical safe abortion services in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa,”; and “Accessing medical and surgical first-trimester abortion services: Women’s experiences and costs from an operations research study in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa.” The first study showed that offering medical abortion with a combined regimen of abortion-inducing medication mifepristone and misoprostol would not result in increased costs to the public health services. The second study examined the experiences of women who accessed either first-trimester manual vacuum aspiration or medication abortion in public health facilities in 
KwaZulu-Natal. Global non-profit organisation Ipas senior research scientist Tamara Fetters said more widely available access to safe abortion services would give women the reproductive justice they deserved.
