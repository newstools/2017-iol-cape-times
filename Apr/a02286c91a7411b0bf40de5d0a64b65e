With more than 1 000 influential delegates expected to descend on Durban for the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Africa conference next week, the government is gearing up for a charm offensive to woo and assure investors of the stability of the country’s economy. A high-powered South African government delegation, comprised of cabinet members from key portfolios and led by President Jacob Zuma, will attend the gathering and use the opportunity to charm potential investors and the international business community. Speaking at the Freedom Day Celebrations at Manguzi in Northern KwaZulu-Natal yesterday, Zuma said the summit – which starts on Wednesday and ends on Friday – would bring together a number of heads of state and government ministers, global captains of industry and influential decision makers from all over the world. “This is a wonderful opportunity to showcase our country. We look forward to hosting them all,” Zuma said. The key message by the South African delegation would be that South Africa’s economy remains stable and conducive to investments. This despite two rating agencies having recently downgraded the country to sub-investment grade. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Economic Development and Tourism Sihle Zikalala, who is also part of the delegation, said the event was a perfect opportunity to showcase not only the province, but the country as a whole with a view to attracting investment. “We will go there with the message that South Africa is open for investment, that as the government we are committed to ensuring inclusive economic growth and stability in labour,” he said.
