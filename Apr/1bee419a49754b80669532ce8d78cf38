The organisations, who jointly called themselves the "Freedom Movement", will gather at Freedom Park, Pretoria, next week to demonstrate against Zuma's presidency. Political commentator Prince Mashele said the movement had a wide range of supporters, including Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu.  "The immediate objective of this is to help facilitate a large-scale protest outside Parliament, when the motion of no confidence happens," he told reporters at the historic Hector Petersen museum in Soweto. "We shall not sit back and watch while our children's future is destroyed by a rogue president working with parasitic private interest ... this is our country, we shall defend it." Mashele was accompanied by DA leader Mmusi Maimane, the UDM's Bantu Holomisa and Fedusa secretary Dennis George, among others. Maimane said all opposition parties were on board, and that different countries would be roped in, and requested their support. The SADC region was the first stop, he said. "This requires resources to sustain it. That's why we say we will support any other similar movement, no matter the size. I've been fortunate to chair SADC opposition parties platform... We need the support of SADC, as chair of that platform I will be communicating this to them." The movement is one of many launched across the country, including demonstrations, in an effort to unseat Zuma. African News Agency
