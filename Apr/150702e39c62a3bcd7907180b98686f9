Rene-Tracy’s half-naked, decomposed body, which was bound at the hands and feet, was found wrapped in a carpet in a neighbour’s shed last month. She had been missing for 12 days. Andrew Plaatjies, 50, the man behind the heinous act, confessed to the murder, and is expected to appear in the Wynberg Magistrates Court tomorrow. Rene-Tracy’s family have asked for privacy from the media. It has been reported that her mother, Chrissandre Jacobs, is pregnant, and neighbours fear for her health and that of her unborn child. The director of the NGO Philisa Abafazi Bethu (Heal Our Women), Lucinda Evans, said about 2000 people were at Rene-Tracy’s funeral on Saturday, as both an act of support to her family and a demonstration against child abuse and murder. Evans said residents would be at court tomorrow, and had pleaded with the Justice Department for a speedy trial. “We don’t want this case to take two years to conclude, and we want a sentence of two life terms without the possibility of parole - that is not negotiable” she said. Supporters would also be asking that no bail be granted. In a separate case, the man charged with the rape and murder of 11-year-old Stacha Arendz was due to appear in the Mitchells Plain Magistrates Court today. Randy Tango, 32, made a brief court appearance on Friday, and his case was postponed Stacha went missing in Tafelsig last Monday after she had left her home to watch a movie at a friend’s house in the same street in which she lived. Her naked body was found lying face down in a field the following day. Last week, Tafelsig residents clashed with police and converged on the field while officers cordoned off the area. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said two people had been arrested for public violence after protest action erupted in Mitchells Plain while the police were busy at the scene of the murder on Friday.  francesca.villette@inl.co.za
