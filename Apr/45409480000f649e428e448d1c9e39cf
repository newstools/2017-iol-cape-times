Cape Town fans are in for a treat when the Babasohel show band from India returns with three internationally renowned singers performing Rafi’s evergreen melodies in a unique tribute show to be staged at the Joseph Stone Auditorium in Athlone on April 29 and 30 at 8pm. The brainchild behind the local impresario, Ebrahim Kaskar, a veteran promoter of Bollywood concerts, says the show will feature a short documentary covering Rafi’s life to be projected on the original screen used years ago. The lyrics of the songs selected for the performance have been printed in a special souvenir brochure, which will be given free to audiences. Kaskar explains: “I have been involved in promoting international Bollywood and classical Qawwali music concerts since the 1970s. I always attempt something different, which will enhance the audience’s enjoyment of the production. “The late Rafi has a huge following in South Africa and especially Cape Town, hence my keenness to offer fans a show of top quality. “One thing I can assure local fans of is that the music will be performed by an international band from India and singers who are par excellence and noted for their ability to render Rafi’s songs in an outstanding fashion. The songs chosen are of Rafi’s most popular solos and duets and we have attempted to include those which will truly showcase the artistes’ versatility.” Rafi is credited with having sung more than 7400 songs in various Indian languages. He was the most sought-after singer in the Indian music and film industry in the 1950-1970 era. The singers performing on the bill are Girish Kumar, Mohammed Imtiyaz and the solo female performer, Rani Kaur. The show promises to evoke and rekindle memories of a bygone era with golden greats made famous by India’s musical maestro. Tickets: A1 CD and DVD Centre, 10 Ruth Road, Rylands Centre.
