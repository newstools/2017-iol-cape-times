Four people were injured on Sunday when a minibus taxi crashed into a wall in Strand Street in the CBD. Paramedics arrived on the scene and found the taxi in the left-hand lane of the road, while one woman was lying next to the taxi and three passengers were still seated. “Paramedics assessed the patients and found that a man and woman had sustained critical injuries. A third patient, a woman, had sustained serious injuries, while the fourth, a man, had sustained only moderate injuries,” said ER24’s Russel Meiring. Cape Town’s emergency fire and rescue service had to use the Jaws of Life to free one of the passengers from the vehicle.  “Once freed, paramedics treated the patients and provided the critically injured with advanced life support,” said Meiring. Once treated at the scene, the patients were transported to Groote Schuur and Life Vincent Palotti hospitals for treatment. The cause of the accident is not yet known.
