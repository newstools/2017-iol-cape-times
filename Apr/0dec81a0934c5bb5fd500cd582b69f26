Traffic in the Pretoria CBD is moving slowly as a group of EFF supporters run amok in the streets, singing anti-Jacob Zuma songs. Marchers have braved the rainy weather to throng through Paul Kruger, Madiba, Thabo Sehume, Francis Baard and Pretorius streets. Carrying sticks, knobkieries and vuvuzelas, they continue to sing Struggle songs. They are part of the National Day of Action march spearheaded by opposition political parties to pressure Zuma to call it quits.   Many shops and banks in most of the streets are closed for safety and workers are standing up outside. Some people are standing by to view the marchers and taking pictures using their cellphones. PICS: #NationalDayOfAction hits Pretoria Streets SAPS police and Tshwane metro officers can be seen near where protesters are marching. On corner Lillian Ngoyi and Pretorius streets some metro police officers can be seen redirecting traffic to alternative routes.
