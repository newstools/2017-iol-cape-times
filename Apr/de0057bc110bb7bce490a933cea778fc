For the proposed march to the Union Buildings on Wednesday (and probably on future dates too), seven political parties – the DA / EFF / IFP / UDM / ACDP / COPE / APC – have presented themselves as active participants. But it is unlikely that opposition parties will tilt the balance of democratic power and unseat the elected president in the run-up to the 2019 general election. The ANC will protect its leader, as expected of loyal members in the party of Luthuli, Tambo and Mandela. In the last week, most political parties in opposition and other politically concerned citizens have already made their standpoint passionately clear, visually and in print. If tomorrow they could all be united under an apolitical banner as citizens in protest against corrupt and destructive leadership (without losing their party political independence), here is a suggested name: South Africa’s Democratic National Alternative. Most important: SA-DNA (ie #SA-DNA @SA-DNA). We are all part of our country’s DNA – and if the majority of the people identify with that, the next step will not be attacked as an attempted opposition victory against democratically elected government. It will be a united people's protest against the criminal capture of our country. If this makes sense to you, spread it around. Time is short and the windows of opportunity are closing daily. With optimism, Pieter-Dirk Uys Darling
