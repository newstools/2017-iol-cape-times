The City says the judgment paves the way for it to recover the amount of damages that it has suffered as a result of the collusion by the construction companies. The judgment in favour of the City was handed down by the North Gauteng High Court on Friday. It relates to an objection by WBHO that the City could not rely on admissions made by other construction companies to prove its claim against WBHO. The court dismissed WBHO’s objection and ordered it to pay the City’s legal costs. The City is claiming more than R500 million in damages from the companies. A number of public entities entered into settlement agreements with the various construction companies in respect of damages that arose from the collusion. Government had reached a settlement with these companies in October. The presidential infrastructure coordinating commission decided that these large companies would contribute to a R1.5 billion fund, called the Tirisano Fund, which is supposed to further transformation and social upliftment. This agreement does not include the money which is owed to municipalities. Instead of compensating municipalities for the R112bn loss that they incurred, a R1.5bn trust would be set up to help the private sector diversify. “We have said before that this ‘Tirisano Trust’ is a slush fund set up by national government for the private sector,” mayor Patricia De Lille said. “Instead of compensating municipalities and ratepayers for the R112bn loss that they incurred, this R1.5bn trust has been set up to help the private sector diver-
sify instead of bringing justice to the residents of those municipalities,” she said. The settlement agreement entered into did not come close to compensating the public for the damages that were suffered as a result of the collusion by the construction companies, she said. “After the judgment handed down on Friday, we remain encouraged and committed to continuing to pursue the claim, in order to recover the monies owed to the people of Cape Town.”
