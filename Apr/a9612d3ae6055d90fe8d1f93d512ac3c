The official opposition has welcomed the decision by Speaker Baleka Mbete to postpone the motion of no-confidence against President Jacob Zuma until the Constitutional Court has concluded the case before it. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said yesterday Mbete’s decision would give the Constitutional Court the required respect to finalise the matter. He said the DA had always maintained that the Speaker had powers in the rules of the National Assembly to postpone the debate on the motion of no-confidence in Zuma. “We pointed out in a letter that she has powers. It’s good for Parliament and that the Constitutional Court dispenses of the matter and Parliament debates the motion,” said Steenhuisen. In her letter to Steenhuisen, Mbete said she had considered the letters he had sent to her yesterday and the day before requesting a postponement. She said the programme committee would discuss the matter when it meets in May. “The programme committee will be requested to consider two issues, namely the implications of the postponement of the motion of no-confidence, especially in light of Rule 90 (rule of anticipation), and a possible date in the future for the consideration of the motion,” said Mbete. “This is in keeping with section 57 of the constitution, which provides that the National Assembly has the power to determine and control its internal arrangements, proceedings and procedures,” she said. The UDM went to the Constitutional Court to force Mbete to allow MPs to use a secret ballot during the vote on the matter.
