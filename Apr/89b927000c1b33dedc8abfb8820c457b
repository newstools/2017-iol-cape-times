The alliance is a collection of the world’s largest public health research funding agencies for joint programmes into lifestyle-related or chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, certain cancers, lung diseases and mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries. It is the first collaboration of major research funding agencies to specifically address chronic non-communicable diseases. “This position is about more than just influencing the global research and development agenda for non-communicable diseases. “We are at a juncture 
when our decisions will determine the extent to which we can take non-communicable disease interventions to scale,” 
Gray said. “Ultimately, each intervention must introduce resolve and change lives.” The announcement of Gray assuming office at the helm of the alliance follows the council’s recent meeting at Parliament when a presentation of the Second National Burden of Disease Study revealed that non-communicable diseases are the leading group of causes of deaths in South Africa, accounting for almost 40% of total deaths and one in three deaths before the age of 60. Gray succeeds Professor Alain Beaudet and will commence her tenure effective April 1. It is set to conclude at the end of this year.
