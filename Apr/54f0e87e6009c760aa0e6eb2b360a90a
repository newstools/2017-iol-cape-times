Plaatjies, 50, is accused of the heinous murder of Lavender Hill teenager Rene-Tracy Roman. The young girl's half-naked, decomposed body, which was bound at the hands and feet, was found wrapped in a carpet in a neighbour's shed last month. Plaatjies stood quietly in the dock yesterday, wearing a yellow soccer jersey. Present in the courtroom were Roman’s mother, stepfather, and grandmothes. About 100 supporters, who were dressed in pink in honour of the 13-year-old, were also there. The State had requested more time to conduct another investigation and the prosecutor said they want to go back to the crime scene where the body was found to take new photos, and get the forensic lab results. Plaatjies’s legal representatives did not object to this and the case was postponed to June 23. Outside court there was jubilation after hearing the news that Plaatjies would remain in jail. Community leader Lucinda Evans said: “It’s been a tough time for Rene’s family and today is a successful day!” Evans also said the community will picket outside the Mitchells Plain court on May 3 when Randy Tango, the man accused of killing 11-year-old Stacha Arendse, is expected to appear. The Grade 7 Tafelsig Primary School pupil disappeared earlier this month while watching movies at her friend’s home in Matroosberg Street. Police said the killer had used another child to lure her out of the house under the pretence that her mother had been calling her. “We are here today to defend our children, we're not asking permission as this is a peaceful demonstration and we not moving until we hear no bail!” Evans said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za
