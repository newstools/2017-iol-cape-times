The Madiba Park community, next to Bosmanskloof, protested over the failure of negotiations to secure land for displaced shack dwellers from Bereaville. Resident Sarah Slingers said they were angry because the Madiba Park community had been waiting more than five years for homes. “After the Bereaville displacement of shack dwellers, the Theewaterskloof (TWK) Municipality, Transformation group and government officials began talks with leaders from both communities. Talks have been ongoing since March and no one can give us answers and they are trying to play both groups off against each other,” said Slingers. She said the Madiba Park community would welcome the Bereaville community as their plight was one and the same. In February tensions flared and violence erupted between shack dwellers and residents of Bereaville, resulting in the shack dwellers being forced out of the area and currently housed in tents by the municipality on a camping site. Slingers said negotiations had been postponed a number of times over the last few weeks and after rescheduling again on Monday, the Madiba Park community had finally had enough. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said protest action by 150 people in Greyton took place on Monday night. He confirmed that eight suspects had been arrested on a charge of public violence.
