Earthlife Africa on Wednesday won a victory in the Western Cape High Court on the country's nuclear deal. Here’s the full judgment. The Western Cape High Court essentially found SA’s nuclear co-operation deals with various countries, including Russia, are unlawful. It says SA’s bid to add another 9.6MW of power – equivalent to ten nuclear stations – was not constitutional. It also notes that Parliament has to approve any nuclear deal, and the Department of Energy has to determine SA’s nuclear needs. The ruling nullifies co-operation agreements SA has with the US, Russia and South Korea. Under those agreements, potential nuclear vendors in those countries – such as Westinghouse in the US and Russian state-owned Rosatom – would assist to develop SA’s nuclear ambitions. Rosatom is seen as a strong contender to secure a contract to build new nuclear reactors in South Africa.

Eskom is expected to issue a request for binding proposals from potential vendors by the end of June. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
