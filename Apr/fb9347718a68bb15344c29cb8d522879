MPs will know by the end of Monday whether they will use a secret ballot when they vote on the motion of no-confidence to remove President Jacob Zuma from office. This followed court action by the UDM to force Parliament to use a secret ballot after the ANC said its MPs would vote as a block. Opposition parties said yesterday they were united in their efforts to ensure that Zuma was forced out of office. DA leader Mmusi Maimane’s spokesperson Mabine Seabe said every effort was being used to get Zuma out. He said a number of marches have been planned for April to send a message to Zuma that he was no longer wanted as president of South Africa. He said the ANC was betraying the trust of South Africans by refusing to allow its MPs to vote with their conscience. Seabe said ANC MPs have a constitutional duty and obligation to vote with their conscience and not toe the party line. “If the ANC on April 18 supports Zuma, it means they have turned their backs on the poor people of South Africa,” he said. Cope spokesperson Dennis Bloem said the court action by the UDM was one of the available solutions to get Zuma out of office. He said the planned marches this month would push the ANC and Zuma to think again. He said Zuma has failed the country and the only way to remove him from office was through rolling mass action. UDM leader Bantu Holomisa said they went to court because they wanted to force Parliament to agree to the secret ballot. He said this was “plan B” for the opposition and they hope the Western Cape High Court will rule in their favour. Speaker Baleka Mbete has said the rules and the constitution do not allow for the secret ballot. Secretary to the National Assembly Masibulele Xaso said last week the rules only allow the secret ballot during the election of the president, Speaker and deputy Speaker. However, the rules do not allow the secret ballot on other votes. Holomisa said the court will make a determination on how the matter should be handled.
