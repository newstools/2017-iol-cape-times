The junk status accorded to South Africa’s sovereign credit rating will be detrimental for black professionals and business owners in the “untransformed” financial services sector. This is the view of Sibongiseni Mbatha, the president of the Association of Black Securities and Investment Professionals (Absip). Absip has a membership of roughly 10 000, which includes black-owned small financial services firms, young and established professionals and asset managers. He was reacting to Friday’s downgrading by Fitch Ratings of the government’s long-term foreign and local currency debt to BB+ from BBB- with a stable outlook; a non-investment grade – or junk – rating. Fitch is the second agency after Standard & Poor’s to downgrade South Africa to non-investment grade. Mbatha said this will reverse the “little gains” accrued in the sector, and hinder Absip’s efforts at helping speed up transformation in the sector. “There is a problem of market concentration where white corporations manage the majority of assets in the country, including in the banking sector where the big five banks control 90% of the market. “So the effect on black firms, although it won’t be as it will be on white firms, it will be an effect anyway. “There is also a big concentration in the asset management sector, with the big, white asset managers managing more than 70% of assets under management. “Black firms are barely managing 4.5% of assets, which is a far cry from what it should be. But that 4.5% will be affected by the downgrade. He also expressed concern at “the flight of investment from the country to more favourable investment destinations” – the same concern held by chief economist at the SA Institute of Race Relations, Ian Cruickshanks who said the Reserve Bank “could raise interest rates by as much as 2% in no time because it will have to protect capital outflows”.
