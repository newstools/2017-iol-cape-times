Thousands of workers in the bus transport industry across the country will down tools from tomorrow after wage negotiations between their employers and unions reached a deadlock. “Regrettably, the intended strike will affect all bus operators other than municipalities, which translates into commuters who solely rely on these buses for transport to work being unfairly inconvenienced,” said the National Employers’ Association. The association says all employers providing bus transport services will institute lock-outs from midnight to ensure the safety of commuters and personnel for the duration of the strike. This means there will be no buses available from tomorrow morning, for as long as the strike and lock-out continue, according to Golden Arrow Bus Service human resources executive Meko Magida. The South African Bus Employers Association and the Commuter Bus Employers Organisation said the employers had offered a wage increase of 7.5% as well as improvements to overtime provisions and travel and subsistence allowances, which the unions rejected. The workers, demanding a 30% wage increase, were represented by the SA Transport and Allied Workers Union, Transport and Allied Services Workers Union and the National Union of Metalworkers of SA.
