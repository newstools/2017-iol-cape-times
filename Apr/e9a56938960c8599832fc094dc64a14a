A man died 10 homes were razed and about 100 people were left homeless when fire tore through “Site 5” in Dunoon on Saturday.The principal of the Bishops School of Skills, Wayne Abrahams, is fighting for his life after he was attacked and stabbed multiple times in the neck, head, shoulder and chest by two masked suspects just after 7am. Earlier Abrahams had reported threats against him to the Education Department after the school moved to discipline a 15-year-old pupil who allegedly shot a fellow pupil in the leg on March 27 in a suspected gang-related incident. At the weekend, rumours started spreading on social media that Abrahams had died from his injuries. But Education MEC Debbie Schäfer’s spokesperson Jessica Shelver debunked the rumours. “This is a rumour and not true. We are in constant contact with Mr Abrahams. We ask for prayers and privacy for Mr Abrahams at this time. We will not be providing any further information at this stage.” Despite reports of one of the attackers being a parolee, Shelver would not confirm this at the time. “The WCED deployed three guards in addition to holiday security after the shooting incident on March 27 out of concern for the safety of all learners and staff.”
