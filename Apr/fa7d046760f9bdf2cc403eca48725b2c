Today marks the launch of African Vaccination Week aimed to strengthen immunisation programmes by keeping it high on national 
agendas. A total of 47 countries will celebrate the week themed “Vaccines protect everyone, get vaccinated!” This year's celebration started as countries begin to implement the Addis Declaration on Immunisation, a landmark commitment supporting and prioritising immunisation in Africa. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s regional director for Africa, said: “Vaccines provide benefits beyond health outcomes, such as preventing medical costs and reduced time caring for sick children. "These savings can lead to improvements in education, economic growth and poverty reduction.”
