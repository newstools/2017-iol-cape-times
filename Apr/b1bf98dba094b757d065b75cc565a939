Last night, Zuma’s office released a statement that he was not opposed to today’s planned march. His spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga said:  “The Presidency has noted media reports that it has opposed a protest march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria. The Presidency respects the right of South Africans to protest peacefully, as enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic.” City of Cape Town spokesperson Priya Reddy said notices were considered by the responsible officer in consultation with the authorised member of the SAPS. “Some of the groups who had submitted notices consolidated their submissions under the auspices of Voices to Save SA. ‘‘This group has been granted permission for 8 000 participants to march tomorrow from 12.00 to 14.30pm.” The route will start at Keizersgracht, proceed down Darling Street, left into Adderley Street, left into Spin Street, right into Plein Street and on to Parliament. The City said permission had been granted for gatherings in Rosen Park, Durbanville. There were also planned gatherings on Joostenberg Vlakte. “The City’s safety and security directorate will assist the SAPS to regulate the gatherings from beginning to end, including putting temporary road closures in place where necessary.”
