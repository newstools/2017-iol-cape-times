Hence I missed the speech by Lindiwe Sisulu which you published. It was a moving speech dealing honestly with problems in the ANC. What is so striking is her admission that despite being well informed about some nasty developments she admits to “doing nothing”. So what is the value of her ANC membership and all the declarations she and others make on a regular basis? ANC leaders have become highly skilled at pious admissions at conferences which are forgotten as soon as the next song is sung. Sisulu ends with a clarion call to “reignite the burning passion”. But we need to know what action she and others will take to correct the outrageous actions of her leaders in the cabinet and ANC. She is right. The veterans are thoroughly disillusioned with it all.
