The man accused of plotting a coup made his first appearance in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Friday morning. Elvis Ramosebudi's appearance in Court 17 was brief this morning after magistrate Vincent Ratshivumo postponed the case until May 2 to allow the accused to get a legal aid lawyer. Ramosebudi told the court he was unemployed, and was asked by the magistrate if he had ever been committed to a mental institution. “I can't recall,” he answered. The 33-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday in Midrand by the Hawks for allegedly plotting to assassinate President Jacobs Zuma, cabinet ministers, members of the Gupta family and other prominent South Africans. The assassinations were allegedly to be carried out by snipers. The Hawks also allege that he founded a group called the Anti State Capture Death Squad Alliance. Prosecutor King Masemola told the court Ramosbudi had been using his own bank account for the alleged plot and had approached companies, including Anglo American, for funding for his crime.
