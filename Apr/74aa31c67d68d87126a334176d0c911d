Freedom Day marks the anniversary of the first democratic election in the country, in which people of voting age from all races and ethnicities headed to the polling stations. With over 60% of the votes going to the ANC, Nelson Mandela became the country's first black, and democratically elected, president.  Sontonga, was also a choirmaster and poet, and composed the song Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika (God Bless Africa) in 1897. It became popular over the years, and according to Google, was even recorded in a London studio in 1923. Singing the song became "an act of defiance" during the liberation Struggle against apartheid, as the South African government noted on its website, and was adopted by the African National Congress as its anthem. Because of this connection the song was banned during apartheid. In 1997, parts of Nkosi Sikeleil' iAfrika were fused with the country's former anthem, Die Stem (The Call of South Africa), to become the current national anthem of South Africa. Freedom Day, celebrated on April 27, is a public holiday in South Africa.
