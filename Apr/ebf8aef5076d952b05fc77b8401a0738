A man who chose crime as his career was jailed for four years yesterday for possession of a stolen vehicle and possession of live ammunition hidden in the magazine of a toy gun. Mogamat Daniels, 39, a father of three, appeared in the Parow Regional Court before magistrate Constance Nziweni, who said his list of previous convictions showed he did not learn from his mistakes. He was jailed for four years for possession of a stolen vehicle and three years for illegal possession of ammunition. The court ordered that the two sentences run concurrently, which means he only serves the four-year sentence. It seems that his good fortune – the purchase of the vehicle for only R13 000, and then picking up a toy gun with live ammunition in its magazine – turned into misfortune. Had he behaved calmly when he noticed the police as he drove around with friends, instead of speeding away, and causing suspicion, he might not have been stopped. As it happened, the police caught up with him after a high-speed chase, to discover that the car was in fact stolen, and to find the toy pistol with live ammunition hidden under the front seat. Prosecutor Barry van der Berg was unable to gainsay Daniels’s claim that he had picked up the gun in the street. The court would be failing in its duty if it did not impose a jail sentence, the magistrate said. African News Agency
