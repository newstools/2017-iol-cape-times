The aim of Open Streets is to create a platform for the community to be creative while encouraging social interaction. Various sports, including soccer, basketball and tennis, free health checks, a playground for children and gymnastics were the order of the day, along with drawing and skating. There was also an opportunity for food vendors and clothing stalls to showcase their goods and a platform for live performances that included poetry readings and traditional dancing. The event was attended by Mitchells Plain residents and people from the surrounding communities of Philippi, Lower Crossroads and Khayelitsha. Mitchells Plain resident Reuben van Dieman, who rode a bicycle throughout the event, said the initiative sent a “powerful message” that the streets were not only for cars. “This is how streets should be. I would not mind this happening once a week, or at least monthly. I am enjoying myself,” he said. Van Dieman said he was part of a freestyle bicycle club and found himself enjoying Open Streets more than when he rode with friends. Khayelitsha resident Bathandwa Ntongana said he and his family followed the Open Streets wherever they were. “It’s such a good event to take children out and let them play freely,” said Ntongana. The event follows similar ones in Langa and Bellville in October and November last year and in the Cape Town city centre in January this year. Mayoral committee member for transport and urban development Brett Herron said Open Streets days gave residents the opportunity to experience streets “as safe and welcoming public spaces where we can connect, socialise, and participate in activities”.  sandiso.phaliso@inl.co.za
