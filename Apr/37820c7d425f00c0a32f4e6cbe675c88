While Cosatu had called on Zuma to resign, it warned its members not to join the anti-Zuma marches, particularly to the Union Buildings. At the weekend, the SA National Civics Organisation (Sanco) expressed its concerns at Zuma’s governance, echoing the SACP and Cosatu, that he had failed to consult tripartite alliance partners on the changes to the executive. “We are extremely concerned that the ANC, as leader of the revolutionary alliance, did not consult us on this major decision, thus Sanco cannot defend the decision taken without it being consulted. “Sanco can ill-afford to work hard to mobilise for the ANC during elections but 
it is not consulted when major decisions are taken especially those that have a bearing 
on our communities and the poor. "In this regard Sanco conveys its appreciation to ministers and deputy ministers who have served this country with distinction and have since been redeployed,” read the Sanco statement. On Friday in Cape Town more than 12 000 people marched to the gates of Parliament, demanding that Zuma step down, blaming his administration for the country’s stagnant economic growth The City of Cape Town had earlier indicated that it had expected 8 000 protesters. Yesterday mayoral committee member for safety and security, and social services, JP Smith, said the City’s CCTV network had picked up about 12 000 people in the city centre and 20 000 across the metropole. Around the country an estimated 80 000 people are said to have turned out for the anti-Zuma protests. The protest was not just restricted to the main centres, but also to small towns. In Montagu, protesters took to the streets to make their voices heard. The crowd, estimated at around 1 000, moved down Bath Street, the town’s main street.
