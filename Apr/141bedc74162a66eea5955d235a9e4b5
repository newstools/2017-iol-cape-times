Thousands of anti-Zuma protesters thronged through the streets of Cape Town on Friday in the biggest protest march the city has seen in many years. Roeland, Plein and Adderley streets, as well Kaizergracht in District Six, heaved with protesters of different races and political affiliations, many holding aloft posters depicting the president and his associates as criminals. “Hands off Treasury,” read a placard held up by a protester in Plein Street, referring to President Jacob Zuma’s axing of Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas, at the helm of the Finance Ministry last week, in a cabinet reshuffle that has firmed calls for him to quit. “We want a president who cares about Africans and Zuma does not,” said Khayalethu Tyalasha from Maitland, who wore a black T-shirt printed with the slogan “Zuma must fall”. In Keizergracht ,two protesters from the Economic Freedom Fighters held up a placard bearing the face of Atul Gupta, with the words below “Not my president”. One of the men carrying the placard, EFF member Tlhabanelo Diholo, said: “We are here to say no to kleptocracy and constitutional delinquency.” After two hours, the protesters started dispersing. But they carried on chanting, sending shouts of “Zuma must fall” reverberating through the city. A policeman was overheard telling a colleague it was the biggest march in the city since 1999. Parliament will reconvene on April 18 to debate a motion of no confidence in Zuma. African News Agency
