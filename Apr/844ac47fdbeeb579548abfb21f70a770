Abader in his recent years continued to play an active role in Pagad by leading its Thikr prayers. Abader’s son, Yusuf, was sentenced in May 2008 to 18 years in prison for the alleged revenge-murder of Ebrahim Satardien in October 1999. Satardien was acquitted of high-profile Pagad member Ebrahim Khan’s murder in 1997. At the time, State prosecutor Piet Steyn said that Satardien’s death resulted from a “cold-blooded revenge assassination” for which Yusuf should be punished accordingly.
