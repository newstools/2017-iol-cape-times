This is a sign that we are in danger. It is also clearer than daylight that the list was compiled by the Guptas. Cope is more than ever convinced that Zuma is the most dangerous enemy of our country’s economy and we are saying that he must explain to the country about who instructed him to recall the former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his delegation from an investment roadshow abroad. Cope wants to reject the allegations that Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas were on a mission to sabotage and overthrow the Zuma government; it is absolutely nonsense. Zuma can tell us about somebody else, but not these two tried-and-tested freedom fighters. Some of us in Cope know these comrades and their contribution in the freedom struggle. Gordhan played a major role and put his life at risk by participating in a very dangerous and sensitive operation called “Operation Vula” to advance our freedom and democracy that we are enjoying today. Zuma can’t and must not try to fool us. Our country is in a very serious crisis. We call upon men and women to defend our hard-won democracy and reclaim our government from those who have stolen it and want to loot the National Treasury. In the interest of our country, let us join forces, work together to answer the many calls, set aside our petty and narrow political interests to save South Africa. The time for collective mobilisation and action is now. Cope is also considering laying criminal charges of high treason and economic sabotage against Jacob Zuma. Bloem is Cope national spokesperson
