His former cabinet colleague Derek Hanekom, who was also sacked last week, has confirmed that he will remain in Parliament until he completes his term in 2019. Speaking to journalists after he addressed a large crowd at the Ahmed Kathrada 
Memorial gathering at St George’s Cathedral in Cape Town, Gordhan refused to say whether he would follow his former cabinet colleagues Tina Joemat-Pettersson, Dipuo Peters and Mcebisi Jonas, and quit. The two former ministers and ex-deputy finance minister Jonas resigned as ANC MPs this week. Jonas and Joemat-Pettersson announced their resignations yesterday, while Peters quit the day before. But Gordhan said he needed some time off after last week’s drama. “I am now resting. Don’t ask any more questions. I will see you on the 18th (of April),” he said before he left the cathedral. Hanekom, who was the tourism minister and had been in government since 1994, said he would stay on as an ANC MP. “I am remaining in Parliament until the end of this term. That is my plan. I will continue to serve in Parliament to the best of my ability in any portfolio,” he said. Gordhan told a packed cathedral that the ANC would emerge out of this trouble and continue with its historic mission of serving the people. He made it clear to the crowd, some of whom were on the steps of the building, he was addressing them as a loyal ANC cadre. Gordhan paid tribute to Jonas and outgoing National Treasury director-general Lungisa Fuzile for their commitment to clean governance. Fuzile also resigned this week after almost 20 years at the Treasury, with six years as director-general. “It’s been a tough 15 months that we have been through. But we are supposed to be soldiers and we should be able to carry through,” he said of his time at the Treasury.
