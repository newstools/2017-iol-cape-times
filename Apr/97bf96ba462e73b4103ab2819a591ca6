The endurance event began at 3pm yesterday and finishes today at the Sea Point Pavilion pool in aid of the National Sea Rescue Institute’s (NSRI) water safety programme. The swim is led by Cape Town businessman, extreme athlete and motivational speaker Toni Enderli, 39, and some of endurance swimming’s leading competitors. Enderli said close to 2000 drownings occurred yearly, of which 600 were children. “Swimmers will try to cover as much distance as possible. "Conditions may become challenging during the swim, but it’s all in the name of making a difference and pushing our boundaries,” said Enderli. He said they hoped to raising enough funds to help 50 000 children receive water safety training, and hoped the swim became an annual event. The swim will also serve as preparation for his next epic swim, the 41km Molokai Strait, Hawaii, in August. NSRI Drowning Prevention Manager Andrew Ingram said water safety programmes were very important. “There are reports of children under the age of five drowning in water buckets or washing machines in townships. We work closely with the Department of Basic Education and engage other departments, and want to run such programmes across all sectors,” said Ingram. * To submit pledges for this cause or for more information, visit Enderli’s website, www.toni.co.za
