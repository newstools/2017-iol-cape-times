South Africa’s theme is Windows on Biodiversity. The exhibit is circular, depicting gardens including Kirstenbosch, Harold Porter (Betty’s Bay), Hantam (Northern Cape), Walter Sisulu (Gauteng), Lowveld (Mpumalanga), Free State (Bloemfontein), Karoo Desert (Karoo), Kwazulu-Natal (KZN), Pretoria (Gauteng) and Kwelera (Eastern Cape). It was designed by the multi-award-winning team of graphic designer David Davidson and landscape designer Raymond Hudson. Davidson described Chelsea as the most prestigious flower show in the world and one of the most important social events on the British summer calendar. “We have been designers of the exhibit for the past 24 years, although this is the 42nd year South Africa is represented at the show. We try to include as much diversity and variety of plant life (as possible), representing all the botanical gardens in the country. We’ve done well (over the years) in winning 34 gold medals and the Huxley Trophy for the best exhibit. One of the exhibits was about climate change. We hope for another gold,” Davidson said. Abrahamse said the exhibit’s success would depend on the enthusiastic team of volunteers who are to join Sanbi representatives and Davidson and Hudson at the show. This year the Sanbi team includes Lihle Dlamini, Lufuno Nen-
ungwi, Mashudu Nndanduleni and Felicity Poole. Davidson said the show was a benchmark for horticulture as well as a  wonderful platform for promoting tourism to South Africa.  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
