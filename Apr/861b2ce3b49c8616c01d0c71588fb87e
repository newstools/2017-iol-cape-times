The arrest of two suspected drug dealers in Summer Greens, next to Century City, has highlighted the battle police and community organisations have with drugs in the area. Police spokesperson Andre Traut says the arrests were made in Summer Greens as part of their “quest to tackle the lucrative drug trade, which is fuelling crime”. He says that during the sting operation, police approached the two suspects and bought 20g of cocaine and 20ml of liquid ecstasy (Gamma hydroxybutyrate or GHB) to the value of R15 000. Summer Greens Neighbourhood Watch chairperson Reagan Crouser says the arrests were made at the garage entering Century City and not in Summer Greens community itself, but could not comment further on the arrests, as the operation was conducted by police. Milnerton Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Lianne Lippert says: “Drug abuse and drug dealing is rife throughout the Milnerton area, including Summer Greens. “We, as the CPF, regularly report problem properties, vehicle registration numbers, etc throughout the area, but, due to a lack of resources in the precinct, are unable to get regular operations to combat this huge issue. "I don't believe that these minor arrests will do anything to curb the problem, as there are many other dealers to fill the void. Harsh sentences need to be handed out to discourage dealers.” She says homeowners are struggling to sell properties due to the crime and drug peddling. “In other areas where information is shared, property values are decreasing and homeowners are battling to sell properties. "Crime is an ongoing problem, especially drug dealing." The two suspects, aged 33 and 36, are due to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court today.
