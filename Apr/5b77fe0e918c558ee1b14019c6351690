Former public service and administration minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi has resigned as an MP, the ruling ANC announced on Wednesday. Ramatlhodi joins Dipuo Peters, Tina Joemat-Pettersson and Mncebisi Jonas, who resigned as MPs after they too were axed in a sweeping cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma on March 31. “Comrade Ramatlhodi has expressed his gratitude to the people of South Africa, the leadership and membership of the ANC as well as colleagues in Parliament for the confidence they have bestowed in him over the years of his membership in Parliament,” the ANC chief whip’s office said.  “On behalf of the ANC in Parliament, we thank comrade Ramathlodi for his selfless service to the movement as a public representative.” African News Agency
