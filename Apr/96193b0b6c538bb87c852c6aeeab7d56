Marketing for the fictitious New Day Clinic, advertising the illegal sale of human organs, promotes the upcoming medical thriller Bypass. Director Shane Vermooten said the project was self funded and with a shoestring budget creative strategies for marketing were required. “Less than two percent of the population are donating organs and the reality is there would be no trade if more of us donated. ‘‘The Organ Donor Foundation (ODF) has backed us and our partner at Media Village Productions in bringing this very real topic to the screen,” said Vermooten. The ODF issued a statement saying the campaignhighlights the reality of the illegal trade in human organs. Provincial Department of Health spokesperson Emerantia Cupido said one person can save seven by donating their organs. Bypass will be released on May 12 and the trailer can be viewed at www.bypassmovie.com. Anyone interested in donating their organs can contact their closest transplant centre or call the ODF’s Toll Free Line 0800 22 66 11.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
