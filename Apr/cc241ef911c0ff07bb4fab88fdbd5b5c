This, as big data instruments, including the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) – an  international effort to build the world’s largest radio telescope in the Northern Cape and 
Australia – are developed. To place the data challenges of the groundbreaking radio telescope in context, it is predicted that data collected by the SKA in a single day would take nearly two million years to play back on an iPod. The summer school aims to introduce fundamental data 
science tools and techniques to 38 talented young science graduates from countries including South Africa, Botswana, Ghana, Kenya and Namibia, who want to develop their skills and knowledge in working on extremely large data sets in any research environment. The initiative marks the first partnership between SKA SA and the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC). More than R1million in funding has been provided by the Newton Fund through the Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy. “The challenge of managing big data sets is going to become increasingly important as we move into the age of omic (gene) and personalised medicine,” said the SAMRC’s grants innovation and product development unit executive director, Richard Gordon. The SAMRC will feature its precision medicine programme as part of the curriculum. SKA SA managing director Dr Rob Adam said: “South Africa can and should play a leading role in the global big data economy, and can and should be a world-leading centre for research and machine learning and cognitive computing. "At SKA SA we believe that the key to becoming a world leader in big data and cognitive computing is to train our best young people in these areas.” SAMRC president and chief executive Professor Glenda Gray said precision medicine afforded people the skill to analyse data across broad spectrums to enhance their understanding of patient health and well-being. The summer school ends on Thursday.  lisa.isaacs@inl.co.za
