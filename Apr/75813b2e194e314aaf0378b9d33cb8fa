She spoke at the Cape Town Climate Change Coalition yesterday, where she gave an update on the City’s new proposed policy towards climate change, and its interventions to address the drought crisis. De Lille said the City was committed to addressing climate change and utilising the opportunities it presented. She said the City had undertaken a new approach with its new draft Climate Change Policy document, its first dedicated climate change response policy. “This policy highlights the importance of recognising the economic and social dimensions of climate change, and working towards implementing responses to address these issues. "More than 750 comments were received during a public participation process last year, and we expect it to be formally adopted by the council as soon as possible,” said De Lille. She said there were immediate interventions in process to respond to the drought. “We simply have to save water while there is still water to be saved. Our 30-year water plan is under review to give greater consideration to climate change, so that we will become a water-sensitive city.” She said this would require managing all urban water (stormwater, groundwater, rivers and treated wastewater effluent) in an integrated way to have drinkable sources of water.
