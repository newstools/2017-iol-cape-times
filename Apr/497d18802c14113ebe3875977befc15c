The incident comes less than a week after a minibus taxi contracted to transport pupils collided with a heavy truck, leaving 18 pupils and two adults dead, including the taxi driver, between Bronkhorstspruit and Verena on Friday. Committee chairperson Nomalungelo Gina said: “This is the second incident in less than a week. South Africans cannot allow the lives of learners to be cheapened in this way. “Children and the youth are our future. Learners have a right to education and also to safety. They cannot be maimed or injured while being transported to school. Greater care should be taken.” The KZN taxi transporting pupils lost control and rolled several times on the Umgudulu Road in Reservoir Hills before landing on its roof. A case of reckless and negligent driving is being investigated. The pupils were stabilised and taken to various hospitals. Gina said the committee would raise the matter of scholar transport with the Department of Basic Education, despite scholar transport being a provincial competence and in some provinces it can either fall under the mandate of the provincial education or transport departments. “We will work with our sister committee to ensure effective oversight on this matter,” she said. The committee sent its condolences to the families of the 20 people killed last week in Sokhulumi Village near Bronkhorstspruit in Gauteng. “This is indeed a tragedy. Our heartfelt condolences go out to the families of everyone involved during this difficult time,” said Gina. The committee yesterday urged parents and the community to be vigilant by reporting unroadworthy and unsafe vehicles used for scholar transport. The committee will discuss the matter in its first meeting with the department after the parliamentary recess period.
